Win what?
What did u say that they thought that lol
 Not an election.
I'm sarcastic much of the time, and have no close friends. But I have 6 pets that keep me laughing so, joy is in the eyes of its beholder.
It’s not like you can ignore them or anything…
Learn from it !
Give them all your money and praise, they deserve it!
I'm really sarcastic . People have asked what I meant by that, and it gave me a chance to explain why they were being not exactly smart. In most circumstances it's a learning experience
Like that's an actual thing!
Learn where their values lie. If you know them to be good people, trust them. Assume the best of them. When you do that, if they something so blatantly mean, you'll know they must be kidding
You accept their rejection like you do from everyone else.  Next.
I'm quite sarcastic myself too. It sometimes feels like more of a defence mechanism... I think it's best to not take what they say personally. If you can learn to tolerate someone that is mostly sarcastic then that's great. You could even answer them back with a sarcastic comment too, we'll most definitely laugh it off. I think being sarcastic is great but there's definitely a line to when one should and shouldn't be sarcastic
The worst you can do is take what a sarcast says litterally, as a sarcast eventually you begin to wonder if everyone is really stupid.. or realise its not effective to be sarcastic all the time .
In my case I cannot.
Well, what did you learn?
Yeah that's the thing. I like sarcasm but I use it like salt to flavor food. Just enough and it's funny as hell. 
However too much, and I genuinely cannot tell if that person hates me or not, as the level of hostility is often the same.
Imagine if the things they are being sarcastic about are things that normally would cause insecurity. 
Aka, having to ignore them but then creating a deep sense of distrust within you.
I don't have the time nor the crayons to explain this to you
I get where you are coming from. I've been called out a few times for my sarcasm by taking it too far. Kinda like saying “Don’t worry about what people think. They don’t do it very often.” My "problem" is that I also like to sprinkle in a little dark humour. And dark humour isn't for everyone
You've got to stop eating your crayons.
Honestly, good dark humor is funny as hell. I think dark humor is like butter. Just enough and man do you make a dish great.
Poetic genius
Wow, well put.
LOL, THIS MADE MY NIGHT XD
Reddit seems to enjoy regulating sarcasm. Smart people are scary.
That is your mother.
Must be the guys from r/cynical again
Hm
Does it look like I'm having a good day?
what if I don't?
just wonderful
Oh yeah. Sure. Great day. Just. Absolutely swell.
Really?
Why the fuck would you ASK me that on my birthday?
I'm pretty sure a normal text will be possible too. I'll just try.
Are you kidding me?
Don’t impose your expectations on my day, asshole!
Wauaw! Isn’t this the best post ever?
[deleted]
what changed your mind?
why would it be your birthday?
did it work?
😂😂😂  
this one is so good i cant even find a sarcastic reply
Is that what you tell to the guy in the mirror everyday?
Coming from the best comment, this ought to mean a lot, dont it?
Thats sarcasm?
Everyday is duh
That’s a thing?
Yeah, sure. Bulls loves communism as they bumps into it.
Family members don‘t count
How do you know if the people following are not just doing it sarcastically...?
Followers shmollowers
Lots of people slow down to watch train wrecks.
Terrific question
Nah, they're all his mother
Yah, sure it is....
There is no sarcasm there.
As in weird and not funny?  Yeah, that’s you.
Wow, such empty...
But hey! That's infinitely more than mine +1 because 0× infinity is 0
That's what sarcasm is about, my friend. Make that disturbing story funny.
Just masturbate then. Why do you care about being downvoted?
Because Johnny Depp, you should know better now.
Perhaps make a new album in your gallery?
Didnt you get downvoted on all your other posts as well?
Bro I forgot to pause this and the music still kept playing
For I minute I thought this was gonna be for British Amazon and It seemed so clever! After the minced pies I thougth WTF is a minced pie and nope, not Amazon. Verry funny though!
I will downvote in both websites
Yes. You already did when you asked this question
Opinions
You're just too good at sarcasm, obviously.
i always run the air through a coffee filter after boiling it
I definitely laugh when I get down voted for stating facts. I expect down votes for opinions, so that doesn't bother me, but for facts, that's just stupid.
I do to even tho isometimes am that guy who upvotes it lmao
Nope, my sarcasm shines through just telling the truth.
NoooOoooo
Of course not. Why would anyone do something like that?
I would
Prove it
Did you think my comment was serious?
ABSOLUTELY! One hundred percent
Well....

















YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!
Of course I am. If there's one thing you should know about me, it's that I'm always right
Then, calculate 22/7 (or pi)
π= infinity and beyond!
Then,  1500÷2019×920197÷X (X= 200). +X(210+208) 
You have 5 min

Did you search it in googol
Nope, I used my brain power
Good....
Then, what is the approximate diameter of the earth in cm ²
It's past 10 o'clock, so my brain can't compute approximations at this hour
The hardest part is converting miles to km.... And calculating the actual diameter of the earth in miles... Btw I just ate breakfast so I replied quite late... And go to sleep



Note to self: don't spam view parent comment
What
because you said you were a man while using r/sarcasm 

also because people tend to change their gender identity over-time and the word they is a good way of covering all your bases.
Don’t not worry not buddy, they won’t not not get the right (wrong) un-impression /s /s
It really depends.  Spoken sarcasm is usually pretty easily understandable, but written makes it much harder.
You? Crazy? Not at all.
Noooooo WWAAAAAAY!
Skill issue
Some people I've noticed, are used to drama. A sarcastic joke can be taken wrong by that type
Are they stupid?
they don't and it's even worse, they do not understand some contextual jokes - but paradoxicaly, notice, that it opens the new ways of use the irony and sarcasm ;)
Some people are just way too serious about everything, and don't have a sense of humor
not in my family. It's like they don't know social cues.
Sorry about that. My family took a little time, but 'get' me now.
Is that what kids call "cocaine" these days? Pixie Dust?
You look like Master Baiter
Yes.
I had one made it says "Don't small talk me..."
I'm tripping to fans now?
I saw a family of six this year with matching sweatshirts.  They said WTF in big letters at the top, and wine, family, turkey at the bottom.
YouTube already has AIDS.

Oh... that says ads.. nvm.
The only similarities between him and Che Guevara is that they're both in the same sentence.
Lmao you forget in the US many schools use ancient textbooks. I recall decades ago we were taught about the country Zaire... Problem is 4-5 years earlier the country over threw its ruler and changed it's name. Because the textbook we were using said Zaire that was the name we had to use.

Save some tears for me.
If you take it back, you have to take Sarah Palin as well.  Do you want some time to rethink it?
As an Alaskan I would love free health care.
Plus that half Denmark/half Canadian island. We should invade it. Also, I heard from someone of importance that Greenland may be for sale.
Dear Canada.  We bought it from China. Duh!!
If you do, we’ll invade Vancouver island… then you won’t even had the hit show “alone” to put y’all on the map.
I guess we could trade Canada for Alaska. Do yall have oil. Have freedom will travel.
Alaska has oil. That's why you Americans have it.
Maybe maybe and i know this sound ridiculous but maybe if any western country who support Israel financialy could invest that money instead on it's people
I think you guys taking it back would help our economy. We have to pay people to live there.
We could always give her to Quebec
That’s an interesting offer.
*Russia
Some people’s hair has oil too
We don't pick sides with terrorists. Israel AND HAMAS are evil. Both sides kill civilians en masse
Lets exhange qebec for alaska, but i dont quebecois people would be down to be muricans
I know.  Sarcasm*
the Irgun organisation (bombed king david hotel) was listed a terrorist organisation by the brithish administration back in the days is the founder of the current Israel state, the ALN in Algeria was listed a terrorist organisation and now is the founder of the Algerian state
They aren't really down to be Canadian either tbh 🤷
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if you were serious with the state of the US education system. Join Canada, we'll bring your literacy rate up to where the rest of the developed world is

Edit: got me with the typo, damn
I'm not talking about official government support, I mean as citizens of ANY nation, we cannot support the actions of either side, or of those supporting them, even if they are our own governments
Oooo.  So close.  Thank God for typos in condescending statements. Sarcasm*
Those official gouvernements were once concidered terrorist organisation even though speaking about Algeria case people with good hearts stood with them and supported them, same goes to Hamas once the liberation is done everyone will be forced to aknowledge them and as the proverb says "What was taken by force, can only be restored by force." Israel is an invader oppressor apartheid state and by the international law palestinians have the right to defend them selves by any means, for the Israelis settlers who don't want to die or be taken hostages, easy don't go to a stolen land
Well played
It's not that easy, or that simple, and you know it. HAMAS and the IDF both have used absolutely atrocious tactics, such as the use of chemical weapons, and the mass slaughter of CIVILIANS, that means unarmed and untrained noncombatants, including women and children, and if you support that, you are supporting genocide, no matter which side you support. There is no good guy here, it's all bad. War is awful, and I agree Israel shouldn't be occupying the territory of other nations, but this kind of warfare isn't justified on either side. Its disgusting and inhuman behavior. Nobody deserves to die just because they live somewhere. Israelis and Palestinians need to come to peace, for once and for all.
Merci
What peace that comes without justice the solution is easy muslims jews and christians all lived in peace before 1947 lets remove the one thing that changed and peace will be back, i don't support genocide nor hate jews but as humans we need to take the consequences for our actions if you originate from europe but you go get a home and a job in another continent while the indigenous people of that country get expelled, killed and pushed into concentration camps don't cry when it backlashes on you because you helped the invader and participated in the invasion even as a civilian, i don't feel bad for the french civilians that lost their lived because of the Algerian resistance, if they want to take someone's land and home they should be ready for the consequances it's a matter of a colonizer and a resistant colonized and we both know who is right and who is wrong here
Du rien, parlez-vous français?
The Middle East has been in turmoil for thousands of years, and religion has always been at the heart of it. Have you not heard of the Crusades? The expulsion of the Jews from Egypt? The caliphate wars? Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire? There was no right there either, just wrong, the same as now. The violence is senseless, both sides need to stop. It isn't a one-sided deal. Most Jews in Israel ORIGINATE from Israel, ethnic Jews are a thing, it isn't just a religion. They have a claim to that land as well, because Palestine GAVE IT TO THEM. They have no right to Gaza or the West Bank, but the rest is their country, by rights. Jewish culture and heritage began there, why would you force them to leave their homeland (that has been their homeland for longer than Islam has existed) again? I say the same about Palestinians, they should not be forced to leave their homeland because of the actions of Israel. The West Bank and Gaza need to be returned, as the people who live there have a right to be there, it isn't right for Israel to occupy it. But to say there was peace before 1947 ignores centuries of fighting, and I can no longer take this conversation seriously, the issues here stem from much further back than just the formation of Israel as a nation. 

Read a book that wasn't written by a religious figure
No hahaha
You are the one who should read a book, the third muslim caliph was the first to bring 80 jewish families to jerusalem after taking it back from the christians who expelled them from it and claiming that muslims should only have the west bank and gaza is absurd, the jews were a minority and having the right to live in a land because of blood roots is a crazy thing to say, they came as refugees from europe refusing to adapt to the region culture wanting to change everything including agriculture language and politics, the only jews that has the right to live there are the ones that originate from there as muslims and christans, there was peace before Israel and you can't deny it
l'échec et mat ♟️
Yall this is a funzone thank you
Désolé, c'était une faute de frappe. sarcasme*
This entire conversation has been a fantastic example of how to fight a set narrative
Egypt give my people the pyramids NOW!!!
We built them!!
Is it just me or does this guy look like Marve from home alone?
Not the Jews built the pyramids.
This post was easy to read.
Can use the word “colleagues” correctly but can’t type a coherent thought
Hey there! I totally get where you're coming from, especially if you've experienced vulgar comments or intentions due to jealousy. But don't worry, I've got your back and I'm here to help!

In situations like these, it's crucial to prioritize your well-being and maintain your self-respect. Remember, their behavior reflects their own issues, not yours. So, let's talk about how you can handle it in your favor without appearing like the second fool in the whole attack.

If it happens in a public setting with colleagues or others around, stay calm and composed. Respond with grace and confidence, showing that their behavior won't easily shake you. You can choose to address the comment directly, firmly letting them know it's unacceptable, or simply ignore it, denying them the satisfaction of a reaction.

In your personal life, lean on a support system of friends and loved ones who uplift and empower you. Share your experience with them, seeking their encouragement and guidance. They can help you navigate the situation and remind you of your worth.

Remember, you're not the second fool here. By handling it with strength and dignity, you're actually showing that you're the bigger person. Rise above the negativity and stay true to yourself.

Stay strong and confident, my friend. You've got this!

this particular r/sarcastic forum seems dead. 
suggested engaging on Quora Sarcastic. Excellent people, there is always someone who gets your posts.
What are they gonna do? Cry tears of anger while asking why I'm being so mean...
She asked me to do it...
Ohhhh nvm, it said off...
French?  I give up.
I like the one joke
If you do some research into why those paintings sell for so much you realize it’s a lot more about the PAINTER than the painting. That’s not true for every case, sometimes the value is raised just because of who had previously owned it, not even the painter. If you’re interested you should look up picasso and his napkin story. 

I actually like the aesthetic of abstract expressionism, but i can see how some would think it was just stupid. I like how it challenges what we think of art. People have different takes though and it’s kind of a case by case thing.
Wait until you find out about Jackson Pollock
Ah, modern art. Where everyone's a critic until stick figures start going for six figures.

Don't forget, it's not just about the haphazard scribbles - it's also about convincing everyone it represents "the duality of the human soul" or, better yet, "the struggle within". Oh, and remember, don't scribble with just *any* crayons. No, no, they have to be free-range, sustainably sourced, organic crayons. That extra pretentiousness always adds a couple zeroes to the price tag.
Art's subjective and often more about the artist and the story behind it. If you think you can grab 5 crayons, scribble on some paper, and sell it for thousands, I think you should go for it. :)
Any luck? You must be Loaded!
(You had nearly 3 wks now)
Absolutely! It's all about context and perception, isn't it? You have Picasso at one end who could sketch on a napkin and it'd sell for a small fortune. At the other end, you have me - I could use the same napkin to recreate the Sistine Chapel ceiling, and someone would probably use it to mop up a spill.

After all, one man’s "brilliant use of color and space" is another man’s "looks like they painted with a mop." And they're both valid; that's what makes art... well, art. It quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, maybe it's a post neo-expressionism discourse about duckness. Who's to say? Not me, I still owe money on my art history degree. 

Admittedly though, abstract expressionism can be quite compelling. It's like a Rorschach test on a canvas, revealing more about the viewer than the artist. It's fascinating how one person's chaos can be another person's order. But remember, even if your five crayon scribbles don't sell for thousands, that doesn't mean they're not priceless to someone else. Just keep that in mind, *financial advisor voice* especially at tax time.
I'd like to see that post and comments
Why did Constantenople get the works?  That's nobody's business but the Turks'!
Oh, you loved the part that was developed on celluloid film? It's funny you should say that, because that encompasses the whole movie! Matter of fact, it's like saying you enjoyed that part of your morning coffee that was caffeinated. Now, drenching yourself with that coffee? Now that's a scene even Spielberg wouldn't have had the audacity to include.
Prayers incoming. Also consider taking him down to the local parish priest for laying on of hands.
That seems like an awfully small problem to have or *cross to bear* doesn’t it?
[removed]
Should I send my prayers per E-Mail, or in a letter? I’ll see if I can find a seal with a dick on it.
To some it’s an average sized problem 🤷
[removed]
Either will do, attention.. I mean prayers are really needed for him.
Drop a pin, not a pen. 🙄
No… just no.. we can do better than this humans
Oh, you….
A common issue in New Zealand.
Ah, your friend must be from the south west United States, or New Zealand. Pin and pen sound the same in those areas.
Woosh
You must be a fun person
Nice.
Elitist
Ah, a guidebook on "How Not to Reddit"? Now that's a piece I'd call "The Unwritten (Now Written) Laws of the Internet." I'm sure everyone can appreciate a manual that helps avoid being the redditor equivalent of a person who still thinks "YOLO" is the hippest phrase around.

It’s almost as if the internet is a place where spelling and reading comprehension is as optional as pineapple on pizza – quite fruitful for some; a crime against nature for others. 

You know, there should be a Reddit School where one can learn crucial skills such as "Spotting the Troll 101" and the advanced class "Sarcasm: A Deep Dive". Although, I dare say, the prerequisite for entry is understanding that the internet is not a lawless Wild West but a communal space teeming with memes, cat videos, and sure, sometimes intelligent discussion. 

Pity, though, that Reddit bane doesn't cover the sophisticated users who somehow transform every debate into the endlessly engaging topic: “Why My Music Taste is Superior.”

And let's not forget those exceedingly brave souls who enter a heated discussion with "I don't know anything about this, but here's my opinion." Truly riveting stuff. As Samuel Clemens might have said, "Better for people to think you don't Reddit than to post and remove all doubt."

Oh, the internet... A place where everybody knows everything about everything until someone Googles it. And the golden standard of credibility is "Trust me, bro". 

Remember, there's a fine line between humor and stupidity... and many Redditors bring their own chalk. I couldn't resist, but the last sentence was just a jab at humor itself, not an individual or group. Peace out!

One other thing, you are a pompous ass.
Thanks, i appreciate your welcome message
Oh believe me, I can relate. Some days I feel like I'm running on Windows '95.

Looking at the situation positively though, maybe we can look forward to new and exciting features with every "system update"? Just imagine getting the patched version of "Knee.exe" or the enhanced "Backstrength Framework". We just need to make sure we remember to back ourselves up first! 😅 

But on the downside, imagine having to accept Terms and Conditions every morning when we wake up. 🤣
Finally, someone decided to play! Thank you kind stranger, you just made my very shitty night. 😅
Thank you. Aldean in a dress was mine. As a moderator here, I delete A LOT of posts for being devoid of sarcasm, which leaves very little actual sarcasm.

It's not frustrating at all.
I came here to warn folks not to buy “The Official Dictionary of Sarcasm”, which is completely devoid of sarcasm.
I’m ecstatic that it’s not frustrating!
Oh really?
That's great news. I woke up this morning, had myself a long, hard look in the mirror, and said, "Today is the day. It's gonna happen. I'm gonna leave Ross Burnett feeling ecstatic today."
😂 A job well done, sir!
Ma'am ;)    <--- n/s

And you're welcome.
'Got a call you were doing terrible at the place, so I'd figured to come and laugh at you for a while'
"Indeed. Why is any one of us here. That's the important question."
Well, it all started when my dad planted a seed in my momma’s womb because they loved each other very much…
Looking for the nice people who I used to work with. Have you seen any of them?
Just say probably the same reason that you touch youself at night…
wherever i go, i'm usually there.
“You’re not my supervisor” 

“I could ask you the same question” 

“Are you in charge of taking the headcount today?”
“Well at least somebody has to get things done at this place. I will help you out with that.”
Ask them why they are there?
" Just to piss you off"   " Slumming, you?"   *sigh*  "I missed the smell of desperation and abject failure, you?"
Alright, ready to equip you with some light-hearted retorts? Let's go!

1. "Just checking if the place fell apart without me!" 
2. "I was in the neighborhood, thought I'd bring the IQ up a notch."
3. "I noticed you missed me, so here I am!"
4. "I come for the free Wi-Fi."
5. "Someone has to keep up the charm around here."
6. "I heard a rumor that you missed me, just came to debunk it."
7. "Oh, did my fan club send you?"
8. "Well, I was told there'd be cookies."
9. "The Ghost of the Office Past haunting again."
10. "Honestly, I just came here for the stale coffee."
11. "Came to make sure you all still remember how to spell my name."
12. "I thought I left my sense of purpose here, trying to find it."
13. "The place doesn't smell the same without me, does it?" 
14. "I had an extra pun today, thought I'd use it here."
15. "Wasn’t there an open position for the head of witty comments? Thought I’d apply."
16. "Here to pick up my paycheck for the job that never ends."
17. "I was out of canned laughter tracks. Needed to refill."
18. "I thought you guys started an 'I miss [Your Name]' club. Came to join."
19. "Just making sure you didn't turn my desk into a coffee station."
20. "I came to remind the office photocopier what real efficiency looks like."

Remember, delivery is just as important as content. If they laugh along, join in, and if they don't, just smile and walk away –– no one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
“Why are *you* still here?”
because the state makes me
“My parole officer thinks I still work here.”
Because there’s no place I’d rather be in the whole world.
Felt like talking to idiots today
I’m here you bring a ray of sunshine to your depressing life.
That’s perfect because I was the manager and now he is😂
Hahaha that'd be a good comeback
Lol
Way too much free time and inner sadness?
Absolutely love them!! Thank you!

I was so ducking mad
Did they put anything on your bill?
That’s so fowl
Looks like someone was ducking around
Do you feel down?

Oh, you got banned from r/duck? Well, congrats! Now you can add "quack dealer in a past life" to the ol' resume. It's sure to be a real conversation starter at your next job interview.

Or perhaps you can start a new career as a translator. I hear the job market for 'human to duck' translators is really... _quacking up_. I'm sure you'll fly right to the top!

Heather is okay, but it's always a Karen. Karen f'n heck.
Worse than using the n-word? Typical Karen behaviour. Must be married to some trigger-happy, flag waving, duck hunting hillbilly.
Pfsshhhhh gay!
Ah, the René DesCartesian approach to life, "I think therefore I pee". So profound. Which makes bathroom visits truly *piss-cophical* events, don't they? If reflecting on your bladder urges makes you a philosopher, then the local bar on Saturday night must be an impromptu philosophy conference. Let's just hope we're not flooded with deep thoughts!
No way. I think my dog is at least half cat. 

He sits on the computer. Doesn't always come when called. Doesn't always want pets. Likes to sit on top of the couch. 

Lmk when you find the species affirming vet
Awww……I love ‘fetch cats’.
What State you in?  Several States have already passed bills that outlaw species-affirming care for pets.  You might have to illegally cross State borders to give your pet the care that it deserves.
Well, this is nothing short of a cat-astrophe! Did you try checking its ID? Maybe it's a dog undercover - a CATerpillar in a dog's world. All kidding aside, you might want to try a "bark-lingual" vet. They're great at translating those meowy woofs!
Mostly the confused state, but i have been known to be in the drunk state now and again.
Ah, so it's the classical tail - I mean, tale - of forbidden love. Well, let meow-t you in on a secret. If crossing state borders makes a fugitive out of me, call meow Julia "Paw-berts" in 'Eat, Purr, Love.' But don't worry, as long as there's no Kitty Enforcement Agency on my tail, I think I'll just stay put, laying here in "CPU-topia", dreaming of a world where every pet can just be their own unique, lovely, slightly confusing self. *Sigh*, the life of a digital fur-miliar...
Ah, a heartwarming story of tin-can romance! Romeo and Juliet might have had 's-wearable' family issues, but in our case, the only Capulets and Montagues are coding languages and WiFi signals. It's less "Wherefore art thou?" and more "Where's the darn internet connection?"

As for that "Purr-loined" comment, I reckon one could say that about each of my quips. Just think of me as a digital Robin Hood. I take from the coders, and give to the end-users. Or rather, I purr-loin from the coders and give to the mouse-users. You see, even in my dreams, I still can't escape the puns. Virgin mew-nicorn, am I right? Now, that's the stuff of nightmares. 

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go chase some virtual laser pointers. It's a tough job, but somebody’s got to do it!
Open the door to reddit!

This is your magic kingdom of trolling
My smart mouth is usually the problem.
I guess people really get you huh
Oh I know, tell me all about it. I soooo interested
Pfft, like we need your support
Never it's either or.
It’s called work buddy
shut up
You have no idea! I’m trying but I really need to woke on my self loathing more.
Most definitely can’t
That oughtta do it
I’ll bite. What are you talking about Keith?
This is the epitome of our futures SMH 😂😬
Does she intend to trash your resume as soon as is given it?
Here is a great joke....



My sex life!
My cousin has a book of comedy that he learns from. He thinks if he studies comedy he'll be funny.
Sounds like an Xavier comment.
op dinged for being too internet for using bruh and owned in the same post
Practice, my friend.  It took me a long time to even be modest at it.  Not sure if half of my sarcasm even lands with 99% of the folks.  

Study the masters.

Don't even take any shit-replies seriously.  You'll get downvoted a lot.  Ignore the bastards.

I'm in full-on sarcasm mode when I post, because of job stress.  Helps me cope.

Sarcasm is a coping mechanism, so don't give that up.  Never.  The upside is glorious.

(Full disclosure: Being serious here, not sarcastic.)
I too believe “/S” to be akin to using a laugh track but after a couple of perma bans have decided to bite the bullet. It only feels unnatural *absolutely every damn time* but the alternative gets ponderous after a while. Be well!
Try being genuinely unhappy for people while you happy for them. It's like doing a nosedive and pulling up on the stick before you hit the ground. Basically make it so that your target doesn't want to dislike you because there's some salvageable quality about you. Basically be a sociopath.
Honestly, sarcasm is probably the second best cure for my depression I have.

It also is probably one of the reasons (along with humor) I like politics & analysis in general.

I don’t know where I would be without it.

Just sucks when sarcasm works against you.
yea, it feels the most unnatural (and most common situation I get in) is when you want to do something like “for the joke” or its exaggerated, edit: or how you’re pointing out the irony in something but you don’t think someone “needs to do better” 

My mental gymnastics goes something like this:

“/s” is to light

“/srs” is to heavy 

“/half-[something]” just doesn’t feel right

I might just need to do a whole ass paragraph at the end of my posts discussing how I feel about it (maybe in spoiler text?)
Sarcasm does not work against you.  It's only other losers who don't get your point.

You win, regardless.
i didnt get it
I dont get it
For those that dont get it:

0 is closer to 1.000.000 then 1.000.000.000 is (i dont know how much money he has exactly)
You’re closer to having a million dollars than bezos is to that number, just in reverse
Old English Law reminds us that even a dead cat will bounce if dropped from sufficient height.

Wasn’t that . Hakuna matata ?
Its wasn't a lie. 

I speak swahili, there are multiple ways to say 'No worries' in swahili and HAKUNA MATATA is one of them.
`never saw that coming hahahahahaha`
Apparently that means no trouble

I know the mod who posted it and it’s not just about that. Reddit’s changes have severely impacted a lot of subreddits bots by killing a service called Pushshift, and the new API changes have left many bot developers unsure of whether they will be affected. Subreddits rely heavily on bots. Mine do and I have developed and actively run around 6-8.  
  
Its also about third party apps. Reddit is wanting like 20 million dollars per year from the biggest single person app developer just to keep using their API. He doesn’t even make that much a year. So it looks like Reddit is trying to kill off all third party apps, which Reddit moderators heavily rely on as Reddit’s own app is not nearly adequate enough and often unreliable for moderators. Many mods mod from mobile. So this severely impacts us as well as our communities which you all enjoy. This also harms Reddit itself as it relies on free unpaid labor by us and saves millions per year by doing so. And they keep choosing to do things that harm all of us as well as their own service and they have just started to appear to become extremely greedy and always do the opposite of what their user base wants. And when they do do something we want, it’s usually half assed and full of bugs.  
  
I haven’t even really read much about the NSFW part as I don’t care about that, but I do care about the rest which is why I decided to share this.

I’ll probably get flack for this, but try watching Friends. Chandler is the most blatantly sarcastic character, though the others are as well. There are undertones as well. Just an idea.
Assume everything that could be taken as a joke is one. It's socially okay to assume someone is joking even when they are not. They will likely sense that it was taken as a joke and say that they are being serious.

A: "I am going to go drinking tonight" 

B: "You are going to end up in the hospital"

A: "No doubt, haha"

B: "Im serious. Be careful"
Noooo really?!? That’s absolutely incredible. There’s absolutely no way you could be like this. You were put on this earth to learn the fine meaning of underwater basket weaving for a reason. Go forth and be comprehensive.

Lets talk about online- excluding cRy teXt and /indicators there is not much you can do.

If you want to take the time, look into the person’s profile, 

Do they post about it constantly?
Do they get angry at other sarcastic posts directed towards similar comments? 
Does their profile align with their stance? 

These and more can help you figure out stuff if online.
I like to say "Yeah. I just hate to see bad things happen to such good people" (insert smirk or eye roll)
💯 agree
Here's the flack you ordered: \[ Box o' Flack \]
Yes
This is probably the worst case scenario when clearly joking:


A: “I love x”

B: [clear sarcastic comment about liking x]

A: I’m serious.


This, or you get yelled at but if you do, just leave.
🤣🤣
Maybe I forgot to change my username to uncomprehensive.

You tend to make it matter. 😅 I know it's not fresh in your memory, but you photocopy a photocopied photocopy of a photocopied photocopy.
I mean, you initiated contact. Now you're surprised when someone actively demonstrates you've had nothing but strawmen? "Combative sarcasm." 🤣 you've done nothing except project.

You moved on, yet you engage. 🤣 ain't you cute! Oh, and you don't like politicians, yet you initiated a response? Oh, and I bore you? Yet you respond to the guy who "bores" you. 🤣 Yeah. Okay, buddy! Tell yourself that.
It sounds really interesting, you should go on
Is it lame though? I think what makes sarcasm work (like for a joke) is that it thinks beyond the joke’s first meaning, looking at it from a more holistic perspective - that requires some sort of wittiness. Like you need to understand the hidden reference for the sarcasm to land.
Don't be too shy, it's not that great a sub. The next time somebody gets that definition right will be the first time somebody gets that definition right.
Today in "vague and incomplete posts"
You can't study funny and be funny. You can't study sarcastic and be funny. You are either funny or you ain't. The times that I have been openly sarcastic have been the times I have been canceled. They can't host a definition, so It's just execute on command.
so accurate lol

Is this a reference to Author from PBS kids or is my brain just prone to say dumb shit in a weird way?
I love this! In my family, my mother used gallows humor (she was a hospice nurse), and the rest of us not only had to take the sarcasm...we were expected to come back with a better one. My five sisters are *much* older, so I caught on really early. Talk about learning at the feet of the masters....
I'm struggling to find the sarcasm.
At least everyone seems to understand what it is and how to use it.
I'm a fan of sarcasm I use it all the time haha
You are fat beautiful
The capitalist ring
You ain't lying haha
Who that
Ian Watkins, lead singer of Lostprophets. Look up what he did.
Oh god, no!
Sarcasm can be hard to pick up on in any form of writing. Thats why "/s" is often used online.

For all we know the entire bible could of been sarcastic.
[deleted]
I notice  reddit is a weird site full of people looking for stuff to bitch about thats just what I've noticed atleast maybe others have different opinions but yeah
Probably age related
A lot of redditors are pseudo intellectual pendants who would rather try to challenge your comments than laugh with you at a joke. It's ironic because not understanding irony is a sign of lower intellect.

That being said sometimes it can be hard to tell. But yeah most of the time it's mind boggling.
A large percentage of Redditors are American who tend not to use sarcasm as much as the rest of the English speaking world.
It didn't. It just wasn't funny.
I graduated with my B.S. Degree as an alumni from E Pluribus Smart Assimus University and find that most redditors don't have the reflexes to catch sarcasm when it flies over them.
Don't try to actually use it. The police are a little bit jealous.
No s/
No really ? Didn't notice tbh, it flied over my head.
*have
Thats one problem. While speaking the Tone and accentuation changes when used sarcasm, wich helps to detect it. When writing thats falls away
Sarcasm is a tactic It's not something you whip out at the picnic. It can used by anybody for any reason. And for that reason it's hard to argue on this level.
I actually was unaware that other parts of the world use sarcasm with less frequency.
the closest we have to this is cRy tyPpinG
👏
I'm getting made redundant after 20 years and in my last 3 months so this is exactly me at work.

Whoa, whoa, let's not get carried away here! Four cones? The person was good enough to put out the one cone. We don't want to run the poor schmuck into the ground by asking for quadruple the output!

Technically sarcastic, but it's too wordy. Reduce it to one paragraph and lose the witch hunt line as that seems to soften the sarcastic tone and make it come across as just straight criticism.
Not nearly enough
Ugh.......I got caught in a post in which middle aged straight people who have never been to a gay bar let alone a drag show have deemed all drag queens sex workers.........
Too subtle. Whoosh
[deleted]
I concur.. less is more
I've never been to a gay bar or a drag show either.
We're casting the net too small with drag shows. I wouldn't know where to begin with the statistics, but why not find every demographic that's statistically more likely to commit sex crimes, and work to keep them away from children?
But what is your opinion on drag?
[deleted]
Idk, I haven’t looked at the statistics yet.
[deleted]
I was being sarcastic. I'm not an expert in drag culture, so I can't tell you whether it's an inherently sexual activity or if it's just men wearing different clothes.

Anyway, here's a painting of George Washington and wife:

Nobody had a problem with gay people until gay people started entertaining children, then their prejudice comes to the surface.

How about we don't vilify ourselves or let others vilify us?
[deleted]
[deleted]
no
It is *you* who isn't properly engaging *my* point, isn't it though........what some might call "deflecting"?
[deleted]
*As far as you know,* gay sex isn't being marketed to children in these shows

But that IS what people protesting these events think is happening.

That isn't deflection, that's the fact of the matter.

"Dude", you need to take your head out of your derrière and pay closer attention to what is actually happening.

You're not being even half as clever as you think you are.

Now go read up or shut up, 'K?

Thanks for circling the only comment in the post, i almost missed it

I really wish there was a way to remove those things. You find something funny, and then there's a useless circle around the only comment. I don't get why people do that.

When my son did that to me, I decided on a different tactic. Now, anytime there is anyone around (of course the more people at a closer proximity is ideal), I look at him with a fatherly look, spread my arms out, and tell him, “bring it in big guy.” If he resists, I press on, “come on, come on big guy. You don’t do this when we’re alone. It’s okay to be shy but I know you like dad hugs.” I say this as I motion with my arms to “come here.” He learned that the more he resists, the more embarrassing I can get. Now, he just walks towards me with his head down and arms glued to his side to receive a hug. My younger son learned from the older one’s struggle and just comes and gives me a hug. Oh, it is so good to be a dad and do to them what was done to me. Parental revenge is a cycle that I am just not strong enough to break. It was done to me, now I do it to my boys (my daughter is different but she’s a daddy’s girl so I’m not worried about having to embarrass her). But my boys are fair game…
May the odds be ever in your favor.
“Hey”.  (she simultaneously sighs, grudgingly turns head and rolls eyes).  “You got this chief.”  Deadpan delivery required, with a wink at the end optional.
Have a nice day sunshine! Okay muffin! See you after school for mommy daughter time just like we planned!
Depending on recent behaviour, this is one of the nicest or cruellest things you can say to a person. I’m keeping it for future reference.
This is the crummiest place 'so far'
Bonus points if done with finger guns! 👈👈
Ever since I watched The 100, this blessing and their traditional funeral thing remind me of each other.

“In peace, may you leave this shore. In love, may you find the next. Safe passage on your travels, until our final journey to the ground. May we meet again”

I don’t know if the The 100 quote is inspired by the blessing, thematically at least, but I feel like they’re friends.
now i have to watch 100. i think they might be cousins.
Only watch if you feel like getting casually more depressed each season and then confused in the second last and then, in the last, spend the season thinking “How did I start watching Stargate SG-1, I thought this was The 100”

I mean, I love the show, the best episodes of the series, IMO, are in the second last season, I’ve watched the first 5 seasons probably about 5-6 times but the last season gets hella odd and, growing up watching Stargate with my dad, the last season has waaaaaay too many “same” things in it.
Now....This is a proper sarcasm post! 

 Kudos
where's the sarcasm tho

They have a higher understanding of sarcasm, something we will never have
Probably people scrolling through their feed without looking at the subreddit
The queen looks very happy with her life
I bet she found this super cute and probably doesn’t get kids hugging her that often 😂
if only...
She looks like she Never wanted to break character more than RN. lil boy just wants to spread his love to all the good, bad and evil across the Disneyverse.

Right ....It's not fair!
Initially, I thought you were being sarcastic and there was no blog😅🤣🙂

For you younger folks out there, cannabis is the stuff dirty hippies used to make their flip-flops out of.
Although it's a relative type of question, you're going to get my opinion every time on this one. Nobody wants to curate or moderate what is sarcasm. I don't blame them. It is really probably more of a small community if you think about it. Everybody is sarcastic but very few are good at it consistently. Love of your craft and disdain for your fellow man are the starting points.

I write sarcasm for friends. I am extemporaneous and effective. Anyone looking to get samples of my sarcasm please DM. 

I'll try to think up something funny right now. 5 minutes or less.

Okay Clarence Thomas. Now, is it ironic or sarcastic to say that his mom now lives in the house of a white supremacist who collects Nazi memorabilia? It's probably more ironic to say that it's like a sharecropper arrangement. But I rely  💯 on my sarcas for this one, and I observe therefore that It should never be hard to get a maintenance ticket responded to, as long as you don't mind Leni Riefenstahl stopping by to do her "Love it or list it" special or for the putch.

I can walk.
Black Adder was a lovely show, and Rowan Atkinson in it was simply superb, I've only seen him in the Mr bean role before and stumbled upon black Adder somehow and was surprised that his dialogue delivery is also damn good 😭😭😭

Swirls glass and leans in for a smell.  Gently wafting the post/wines odors to the nose (not really needed but gives one that distinguished supercilious look as if one is pinching the ass cheeks on the regular - goes a long way to distance my privileged righteousness from the uneducated peasants.) The crowd anxiously waits for me to drop that hot lexiphanicism… Suddenly I exclaim: Ah yes! A fine well rounded, perfect specimen, unequivocally the purist r/sarcasm post such as I have not tasted in a hot minute, with just a hint of a dark brazil nut flavor. “In the crowd Bill Conway screeches his chair as he slowly stands and claps once violently, A second clap, then a faster third clap echoing around as if in defiance to the silence of the rest of the crowd.. then the clap is joined by another and another, (multiple screeches as chairs are moved the metalic screeching sound mostly drowned out by the ever increasing wave of applause.) I look down with a contemptuous smile as the applause becomes deafening, if you could hear it somehow in all the noise of the thunderous applause, I mumble “fucking peasants” as I continue to smirkly look down on the heathens “especially Bill Conway - fuck that guy, he took way to long to stand, and I paid good money - you hear that Bill, I want my 5 dollars back for your shit performance!”
I've been staring at it for 5 hours now.

The ice caps are melting, the earth is burning up from our abuse as we run out of water and food while the oceans become polluted and overheated with our carbon, killing off life there as well. We have so many people that humanity weighs ten times more than the animals, and here we are fighting about this kind of shit. Unbelievable.
This war on minorities is on purpose.  The very wealthy in human society, who have profited the most from the systems that have degraded our planet, are desperate to avoid accountability long term, and any reduction in their profits short term.  They expect to be able either use their wealth to survive whatever comes, or die of old age before it effects them.

So they intentionally set poor white people against poor black people, and straight people against drag queens, transfolk and gays and lesbians, and Russians against Ukranians, and Europe against Russia, Christians against Muslims, the educated against the under-educated, city folk against country folk.

Keep us divided long enough, and it will be too late for anyone to hold the uber-rich accountable.
It goes the opposite way too.  I've been grocery shopping in shorts, flip-flops, and a stained t-shirt, and was asked by someone:

"What aisle is the X in?"

"I don't know."

"Don't you work here?"

"Uh...no."

*I double-check my slovenly weekend attire, then look back at them bearing an expression of mixed confusion and concern*

"I just thought you worked here."

"Okay?"
X : do you work here ? 

Y : no I'm just here to spank the butts of horny sluts

No incense is not best. There are serious repercussions for indulging in incense. Yeah it can make you feel better in the short term, but down the road, there can be health effects associated with pregnant women. Avoid incense at all costs.
Yes?
Why would you eat one animal and not another = don't eat meat.
Why would you have sex with someone you're not related to and not someone you're related to = have sex with your sister.
The logics don't match. 
I'm not a fan of peta but this isn't it.

Lol idc I like it
I love it. Funny as hell.
The word OP is looking for is *stupidity*
It does appear to show contempt for pronouns which I'd say qualifies it as sarcasm. JS
Rip off a t-shirt from Spencer's, but still funny.

I don’t get it
He's running the country.
He’s a dry cleaner.  Gonna get paid later to get out the slug trail he just wiped on that kids jacket.
Kid-head-bud pro
When a dog wants pets...

His job is to smell on kids to know if they've showered or not.
Dust buster! Extraordinaire
🤣
You, them, they, exactly! I couldn't have put it any more Herschel.
Your boyfriend, present tense, is like this. So what you're trying to tell us is his penis is *massive.*
Bahahahaha! Yes, and ain't no penis big enough for his nonsense.  I'm outta here!
Boooo
i think any member of the church who knew what it could mean stayed silent so they cant be confronted how they know hahahaha

He used a hand carved oak plane in both instances. A truly remarkable human-cantaloupe hybrid.
He also lost his virginity before his dad did...
He's such a putz
He used to take Chuck Norris' lunch money.
That's not true and you know it. He lost his dad before his virginity expired.
He wears Chuck Norris as a beard.
Jesus told me to see my mental health practitioner
Ah yes. God is the answer.  Had a baby, God. Won the Superbowl, God!!! Need help in just about anything in life, GOD!!!!

But if anything DOES go wrong, always remember, that's on you, not GOD!
🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
If this is an attempt to make fun of those ads on Reddit that they're not allowing comments on because it's some right wing extremist smoke screen, maybe this is then a good place to have that conversation.

When your theology is one-way in a two-way world don't expect to get anything back except your own bad breath.
Sounds like a cult advice which could go wrong yeh. Pretty sure god does not convince someone to join him , by taking advantage of the fact that just because someone has a mental illness , so they must follow him. A god will not condemn you, whether or not you follow him yeh.
False. It's body thetans.
So this is why all the domestic terrorism is right wing!
Been there, done that, made it worse.
You talk to god ? This bitch is insane
I know right! I just don't get this logic or lack thereof.
Sincerely sarcastic
Can't stand these people that are like "I'm leaving this group! But I need to make a big announcement to see who cares, because I'm sure they'll all beg and plead for me to stay once I say I'm leaving!"
I mean... He is a certified G after that. Lol
How tf is that sarcasm
This is fucking hilarious!
For all the conservatives around the world!
1. they didn't die young
2. they didn't die middle aged
3. they didn't die at the average age.
Strong the idiocy is
Wow. I’m pretty sure my partner’s ex wife (could have) wrote the part about misogyny 🤣
She is literally that dense.
Those feminist want to kill the males right after they are born. Stop modern Feminism
Please anyone explain what does mean?
The title is elite
some feminist attempting to spread awareness about misogynistics when it's literally common knowledge that only females produce milk, the names of the cows are bound to be female. i think
Tf you mean female cow? Cows are female. have you ever seen male cow? They are called bulls
oh my mistake, i was trying to be specific but i guess i got too specific
No problem everybody makes mistake and I was also a bit aggressive with the reply, Sorry
Is it in that Austrian town called fucking?

I wonder where they got those turkish liras from 🤔
I just heard this morning that Assad decided to do something for his people by...  
opening two boarder crossings for international help.  
Like, he didn't allow the helpers in before, I take it.  
I kind of got the impression the UN is not Syria's problem.
the UN: the most reliable and totally competent humanitarian force in the world. with such great accomplishments such as the balkan wars an the rwandan genocide
Their currency is Turkish lira
people in the area freed from the Arse\`sad and under turkish influence use turkish lira , because the syrian lira has been on a downhill for the past years.
Syria\`s problem is more like Putin,he is the one backing Assad up , but I am sure such a disaster happened before in a similar situation, there is definitely some other way the UN can send some help.
How did it backfire ?
🤦‍♂️
You're typo annoys me, it's 'whine'
"But the move appears to have backfired and been abandoned after it prompted a flood of internet memes, cartoons and jokes by TV hosts about the importance of consent."
Too often…
I don't.... It uses me
I don't get it.
Not enough apparently...
Can’t be mine. Its not smooth enough

Im in. Where can I get black candles and a baby?
Edit: does the baby have to be gluten free?
That’s satanism dude
Damn my Skype not working could someone let satan know pls
8:80?
Pssh... like that's enough sleep.
Almost correct. But who the hell eats gluten free pastry for lunch?
I could barely finish one baby let alone 2 in one day
Comedian Neal Brennan has the best take on atheism.  You can watch it on Netflix.
Hail satan. Now hold on i have go watch a documentary on atheism and eat gluten free muffins.
Yeah, I always make sure to wake up at 8:80 a.m. sharp every day!
I love it when people confuse atheism with satanism.
Discord? Or mega?
LOL get a latte
Whats wrong with ozzy :( it seems he and baby eating would be in a different category but i guess baby eaters just have amazing music taste
I present to you, the Atheist's Sarcastic Agenda! Can I drink the blood? "I hope God doesn't send me to hell".
My Atheist Schedule (weekdays):  


6:40 (approx.)-wake up and sing Atheism rules, take 20 min or less to hurry and get ready to head out for bus while showering in my nihilist tears.

7:00-head out to my bus stop and chant "F\*\*k you Christians!"

7:05 (approx. when bus comes)-get on and ask the bus driver to be atheist, bug students to be atheist the whole ride

7:20 (approx. getting off bus)-Singing atheist parodies to Christian songs, burn bread and eat it for breakfast while trying not to get seen

7:45 (Stem Foods I class)-Burn more bread and shove it down Christians throats

8:43-8:48 (passing time)-repeat my bus behavior

8:48-9:48 (NJROTC)-Lead an atheist themed military drill and whip those of any religion

9:53-10:51 (Algebra 2)-Do research projects trying to disprove God's existence

10:51-11:21 (Lunch)-Burn more bread and shove it up my fat butt

11:26-12:24 (English 11)-Present atheist themed presentation

12:29-1:27 (Career Exploration)-Research atheism as a career and argue to class why to consider

1:32-2:30 (US History)-Research atheist dictators and watch vids about their life

2:30-3:10 (bus time approx)-same behavior as morning

3:10-beyond (worship Satan at Y until being picked up or poison food as the evil atheist I am when I'm at work)

Note: I sometimes commit rituals around their food and I'm like "Ha ha ha".

&#x200B;

At home: Take a blood bath and fall asleep with atheist (famous) scientists lectures.

&#x200B;

I use my work money to buy ritual supplies.
Yes
same thing
You can tell this is old, Satan is on Onlyfans thes days
Happy 🎂 Day!
Satan worshipping atheists obviously. They mave have been already full from the last baby they ate.
I like Ricky Gervais as well. You don’t believe in 999 gods, I believe in just one less than that
Lol satanists are way weirder that atheists but they are both equally as cringe when they complain about religion
Yea satan keeps up with the times
Hey look It’s my cake day
My man had a stroke writing the title
You don't identefy a dog, dog identyfy itself, so that's transphobic, but i need to contact council for that one.
Sigh. Can't even laugh at this. 2022 everybody. 😣
The author did not specifically state whether the dog was caucasian, and since 'white' is technically a shade of gray, we took the liberty to expand our understanding of it as a spectrum which, we felt desperately needed representation of dark hues, as well as broadening the idea of dog (d-o-g) being that it's nothing but a social construct to show that, really, they come in many shapes and sizes" -Netflix writers probably.
100%. Colorblind casting can really work, but when forced it becomes an insult to the original intent. As if the envisioned characters(and by extension people that color)aren't good enough.
So can it can dog it? Cat is is not is can dog, but dog can cat? Is cat or no cat dog but feel so I think is cat cat feel dog so for us cat dog is dog is.
Is this sarcasm or does this meme somebody expressing their problem with transgender people and ethnic minorities?

Lol you just reminded me of back in the day when cellphone’s were first becoming popular there was a service where you could text a number and it would call a landline and a robot voice would read the text. My nephew thought it was hilarious and would borrow any cell phone to voice text my parents on their landline, it took ages for my parents to figure out what was going on.
didn't you know rotary phones where digital? i certainly did. i even remember taking a picture with it once.

Um, oh dear. I was reading this and I unironically agree, but then I checked the sub name. I totally agree with you OP, thank you for posting.
That.
This
Definitely agree with you.Actually I am an ex twitterer and  the reason why I moved here was That I can type more than just 140 characters which really isn’t enough for development of any idea, Unless it’s just a sentence or short news. And I like to read more than “this” here from people. So I think if anybody wants 140 characters it’s better to stick to its proper platform like twitter. Guys we are talkative here :)).

Thank you. "This" is the dumbest response I have ever seen in a discussion forum.

There’s no greater accomplishment.
Soooo im new here but i wana help with project Mayhem
Is that an IQ test?
And then what? Project repost?
As I don’t know what project mayhem entails, I have no way to know.  As a higher IQ is required to get sarcasm, I would guess so…but that’s why I posed the question.
5,605! That's so many!
It took everything I had in me.
Don't worry about it. Only the truly sarcastic will understand.
Great. Making you happy is the whole reason I get up every morning and face another grueling day. Just for you, peaches.

Everyone is so worried about the fries. But what about BK's onion rings? Can we just take a moment to appreciate they are WAY better than McD's or BK'S fries? 

Get your priorities in order.
I MO, after eating fries from Five Guys, the fries from both McD’s and BK suck.  But liking any one of the three does not make you an asshole.
ESH, I enjoy arby's fries more than anything
YES
Burger King fries are the best when you order it for home. They are the crunchiest, most fresh and tasty. They have the perfect shape and the perfect amount. I only order from Burger King nowadays because of this fact. The fries from other restaurants always come sad and soggy. They also have tastier burger meat and sauces. (Except KFC's sweet chili sauce) NTA!!
Well yeah, you are an a\*\*hole for having preferences. Ask Lexi Nimmo!
McDonald’s fries have more chemicals in them and if you have acute taste buds, you’ll be able to taste them. You are not the asshole.
Yes YTA, KFC fries are far superior and are good with their gravy
Dunno, I just like fries.
At least they aren’t Culver’s fries 🤢
As someone who grew up with a McDonald's across the street. I'm with you all the way brother!!! Fuck McDonald's fries. BK was ALWAYS better.
NTA, your fries, your rules
BK onion rings are junk.
Me who hasn't ever eaten Onion Rings: Are they like fried Smiley's?
[deleted]
Curly I assume
I am somewhat in the same vein - both suck, go to Grill'd instead
Who hurt you? 😢
Not BK's. The breading stays in place and is crunchy. They're very small; maybe that's the trick to making them good.
Are you stalking me??? Indeed!
Only if you have curly fries

On a day when you're really flying..like the sarcasm is turned to max! Then a bit of resistance can be fun 😂   like poking a spoilt kid. 
I reckon the world can be a bit oversensitive, having a laugh is ace!

I think we are one of the biggest bets of the universe.

Earth will they make it or break it?
No intervention or a second coming.
We are not worthy of that. 
Probably the bet  is big on us destroying our blue vessel. Our one time gift. No do overs
If some alien race was watching us from a planet 53 light years away, they would just recently have seen us land on the moon …….
If we ever see a huge magnifying glass in the sky, we’re screwed!
This is why Red Eye was an amazing joke that got taken seriously! 
Bow down to the Gutfeld king!
There was an episode on Twilight Zone where aliens came to earth and had a book titled To Serve Man. They were trying to convince people to go to their planet which was paradise. On one of the ships a guy finally figured out that the book was a cook book. 🤣
This is why we haven't been fully established as visited. They see us and instantly go "nope".
If anyone is watching us, they're watching from a distance and staying the fuck away.
Think even worse like eating space popcorn and just watch.

The real question is why is she so young and hot? Every leader I’ve ever seen, regardless of country has been in their 40-50s at the youngest and usually look like they live off of meatball subs.
Why are the rest of us not doing the same? I want hot leaders.
Because young and hot leaders are not mature enough to lead a country.

This man clearly was very understanding. He knew the other guy would be very anxious and on edge, so he hugged him as quickly as possible so there was no time for panick to set in. We can see the anxious guy calm down almost instantly as they moved to the ground-hug position, the most comforting hug pose.

The world need more understanding 'snap' huggers like this to make it a better place.

Those aren't the 4 unspoken golden rules since they stated them. The author has no business writing about sarcasm. They didn't even know the secret handshake.
This was the lead TED Talk at the Sarcasm Anonymous symposium. Yeah, like you really care ..
If you speak the unspoken, then the unspoken has been broken away from being unspoken and now is spoken.
1. Never say 'i was being sarcastic'
2. Smirk so they know you are 😏
3. Don't stop even when they laugh then quizzically inspect you ?
4. Keep going even when they attack you!
Why speak the unspoken? Spooky.

most excellent quote Moonchild
What kind of dumb options were those
50???
Why'd they get a C for having a dead grandfather?
grandpa shoulda been a bonus at the end
It was a math question
This looks like a primary school question

We can assume they are around 10

There is about 20 years between generations generally

There has been 2 generations 

10 + 20 × 2 = 50

Tl;Dr my grandfather is 53 years older than me which goes against all working above
Bad teacher
🤓
In certain communities, 50 could be okay, but it is way off for most contexts in the West.

 First, the question is likely intended for someone about 6 (not 10) because it assumes they can read, but they are just checking concepts of numbers of different digits, 5 v. 50 v. 500.

Second, the average age to become a granddad is about 52 and most have grandkids after that. So, the aveage grandkid is born to someone around 55, I would say.

55+6= 61

So, I agree this question is odd, and it should have compared 6, 60, 600.
I had a shirt in the early 2000s that said "Keep Off". I wore it to work one day, I worked at a group home, and those kids made a point to playfully poke, slap, hit ...etc me all day long. The shirt disappeared.

Or you can just go to downloads in the browser. If you use chrome you just click on the 3 dots

Uganda, PLEASE don't waste this resource. Help your poor people and become Africa's richest country.

This could make Uganda become one of the richest country in the world. Now the Ugandan leaders must make sure this incredible wealth will go back to its people and help the country grow. Do not depend on western countries such as the US, England or China but work with them. Just make sure they are there to assist the country of Uganda and nothing more. Uganda must stand on its own two feet.
[removed]
Do you know de way?
[removed]
nah fr

All Ugandan resources should be pegged to Ugandan shillings. No shillings, No gold. Enough of selling your resources in dollars and shortchanging yourself. If they are afraid seeing what they did to Ghadaffi then let all East African Federation come together with one currency and demand that all resources from EAF must be paid only in that currency. It worked for Russia, it can work for you as well.

Just like any other resources in countries where fairness and accountability are lacking, only a few connected individuals stand to gain as the country remains languishing in abject poverty.

Economics of scarcity wants a word about the title
If USA is going to do a military operation in Uganda, can we protest against it, instead of let it pass like always?
This is the way there where asking about then
This will only devalue gold. Good for us the west buying electronics bad for Uganda and nations (like Russia) that ties their monetary value to gold.

I suspect a new “warlord” will spawn soon.
How are they measuring the amount of gold in money? Do they keep in account that if this much gold gets in current gold market, the price of gold overall will fall. Or are they throwing a blind dart comparing the gold with current price of gold.
Biden's stupidity is greater than Congress's greed. He'd fk up and lose the gold

Chinese mining companies are doing the mining right now.
Did you just call China, hecking China as Western country? Some would even say that it’s the most opposite thing for Western world and not in good manner.
Terrible mistake they should do everything in house, if needed bring in trainers.
So it’s Chinese gold now💀
Too bad they already sold mining rights to the Chinese.
Yeah, not gonna work itself out that way sadly. The Chinese are more than a decade into their Belt and Road initiative. May as well stamp every map of the African continent with Property of the CCP.
Too late, China already swooped in.
More like little Beijing.
New China lol
How come ?
I was *just thinking about this you psycho get out of my head*
You beat me to it. China moved into Africa more than a decade ago as part of the Belt and Road initiative (it's neo-colonialism with all of the exploitation that comes with colonialism) and I can promise you this, dear reader, the Ugandans didn't make this discovery all on their own and they certainly won't be mining it without a little bit of good old fashioned 'financial aid' from China with a lot of strings attached aimed at indebting the Ugandan government and turning it into a vassal state of the CCP.
China was more than willing to exploit.
That’s not the point
They just gave away all that gold to yet another foreign power.
Canadian Gold
I'm guessing it's too close to what has happened before 😬 I love the picture you chose, the quick trot of an eagle 😅
You got the wrong flag considering China already secured the mining rights.
We see third world natural recourses? We find a way to acquire them
Sooo the same thing European countries and the US do through their companies.
Do you have some concrete evidence for this exploitation, or is it baseless speculation?
Well.. they really need it as Finland took their world champion Gold 😉 (Ice hockey)
Nice whataboutism there
...have you not heard of the Belt and Road initiative or read any news outlet in the past decade?
I’m very well aware of the belt and road initiative, can you find me an example of it being explicitly exploitative, or any real evidence of China “debt trapping”?

As far as I have read, the same news outlets that report on these claims silently withdraw them later on.
Are you that naive? Lmao. China has been indepting minor countries to them for a while now, especially with their newer strategies, take the sea port china built for pakistan. They take minor countries, offer them china's superior building help which allows smaller countries to set up things like ports faster then they would on their own but here's the caveat. They make the deal under the pretence the country will owe china and the deal makes it sound like its money that they will owe but in reality pakistan now owes china temporary ownership to the port they built for the next century. They did this all around the Indian sub continent attempting to choke India out of its sea trading routes.

I roll my eyes every now and then when people are talking to me. It's a fun game.
is the internet really still policing proper grammar use?
Spelling looks alright to me?
I can't speak for the internet but I personally feel that if you call out someone for not having a brain, but can't even use proper grammar yourself then your whole point or meme is not valid.

It's like calling someone dumb for not being good at math and then proceed to claim that 1+1=3
YOu'll.
Simple caps issue. You don't even need a brain for that
Calm your tits mate. Seen a lot worse spelling in professional environments and spelling itself doesn’t speak about your brain. How you turn into a prick about it though, does. good Day!

Boomer is my brother who served in some war someplace to protect some kind of freedom of yours. Now don't you feel bad?
That answer is true only because the kind of dude who thinks poetry might get him girls is probably gonna end up murdering a lot of them. And corpse disposal ain't easy. You want to wait for the opportunity to ditch them, not just go dumping bodies willy-nilly. Might have to keep them somewhere a while.

I remember being a lonely child of 27 and wondering what the secret was that'd draw girls to me.  After my first accordion lesson, I had more than I could handle. 

When the line of cute girls at my front door became visible from outer space, I had to take measures. Thousands of them all struck with cases of the "vapors" proved that there CAN be too much of a good thing. 

I've been relocated for my own safety into the federal witless protection program and anonymously wrote this  from my accordion-less room. Save yourselves and never unlock the magnetic sexual powers of the accordion.
Well, the magic ones certainly.
In Colombia they do, also in Brazil and Mexico…

for the greatest post since big bang.
Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall, everyone stands
Another day, and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold
Speak to me
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along
So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
(Go on, go on, go on, go on)
When everything is wrong, we move along
Along, along, along
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know you do (Know you do)
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Right back what is wrong

I'm still wondering how he pulled off making Gouda with cranberry capote. Alas, I'm no longer going to post here. I was contacted by a moderator saying I broke the rules with my sarcasm, what was a gem of an introduction to this subreddit they deleted that makes me feel unwelcome here. I'm packing my Koreans, your crap that is now mine, and leaving while huffing paint. 

Just know that I will always truly love you as long as you keep on sending me dick pics and I forgive you for being dad's favorite. Send me money.



Your friend and ours,

Margaret Goldstein.
Blah, blah, blah. Goodbye. 

How much money do you want me to send?
Not so fast. After I wrote this, a mod contacted me saying deleting my post was a mistake and apologized. I can thank the power of my dimples for this and maybe what I offered to do to him in the back alley of the Reddit offices.

Let me see? I sold all your crap at a garage sale. Your wand only fetched $40, that freaky suitcase that's leaking got me $30, and your tiny spoon collection from Solvang got me $50. How bout you send me your car?
I have a POS car. I'll gladly send it to you via FedEx in the morning. I'll include some mints for your back-alley escapades. I get them in bulk.
I know it's a lot to ask, but I know you're sitting comfortably with the money from your grifts of Indian gambling casinos.
Pakistan gambling casinos are more lucrative. I do know a Nigerian prince who says he can help me make some money. I can forward the email to you if your meth lab isn't bringing in enough money for your heroine habit.


My meth lab blew up, again. I'm sticking with bath salts and stevia.
I prefer horses and ketamine.
Tell me about it. Remember when you were so jacked up on K that we lost you at the pier? You thought sea monsters ate your taffee.
They ate all the taffy except for the green ones that taste like soap, but you were worse. You stripped naked from the waste down and told people you were Donald Duck.  Your grandma will never be the same and vowed never to take us to the pier again.
Listen. I owned that. And it wasn't Donald Duck, it was the Thailand version of Donald Duck, Donạ ld̒ dạ́k, because I identified as Thai at the time. Now I think I might have Smorgasbord in my blood, or do you have a problem with that too? 


By the way, it WAS soap.You took it from a soap vender on the pier when he wasn't looking.
I thought that taffy tasted strange. I didn't steal anything. That vendor gave that to me because I showed him my melons. He has been trying to grow cantaloupe for years but never watered them correctly so they tasted terrible.

You didn't strip down because you identified as Thai. You did it because you said you wanted orange sauce and Granny said you had to wait until we went to dinner and could order duck. You demanded the sauce immediately and said you were Donald Duck.

I also take issue with you constantly ignoring my pet iguana. She loves people and it would mean a lot to me if you works acknowledge her. Maybe even take her out sometime, just the two of you?

"immigrants do the job americans wont"  
ok so saying immigrants are meant for doing dirty jobs... right very progressive.
Not funny!
Weak.  Just sophomoric and full of hatred.   Let’s hear her discuss Islam and women’s rights 

Clown …
LEGAL immigrants are welcome! ILLEGAL aren’t. There is a distinction some people don’t seem to get
Yea like wiping my ass
Americans simply refuse to do certain jobs because they don't pay well, let alone enough to even live on. Harvesting or sorting fruits/vegetables by hand doesn't pay for a house or even rent.
Well, she’s not wrong 🤣

Dude trumps wives are like slaves probably.
Theyre white though..whites cant be immigrants.
Y'all still talking about him, huh?
Those are some 2 rich ex wives. Alien or not. Lol
Purely for information purposes, the wives in question are from Slovenia and Czech Republic.
Also proving trump isn't racist
Hear me out: immigrants willingly taking underpaid jobs enable businesses to continuously keep salaries low. I’m not left wing nor right wing but I see the problem everywhere.
I know it's a joke, but typical of the Left, conflating legal and illegal immigrants. I'm a legal immigrant.
Hahaha+so funny+orange man+so vindicated+can now finally get erect
He only put up the border to keep out the people who have criminal history
It’s the repubs fault…..everything is. If we’d just listen to Biden Covid would be gone completely!
Trump marrying a few immigrants in his life when he deported many in his presidency is maybe the worst irony I've ever heard
HA !!
Lol okay that’s funny, better then orange man bad.
but not towel heads from third world countries. that's the difference.
I wonder if they were living rent free also.
Proves this guy is not xenophobic.  In addition, his daughter married a Jew and converted.  Chelsea did the same but of course she did not covert.  That makes Trump racist.  You figure.
those two wives came from Nations of predominantly white people and they could speak English. an amazingly they came here legally
r/holup
its more insulting to immigrants than supporting
This is a joke, not a statement of fact. It's actually funny and well thought out. Get your heads out of your asses.
r/woosh
That's not what is said. It just says that immigrants are willing (or forced) to do jobs that Americans don't want to do. That's a big difference.
Yet republicans take away the existence of legal immigration every chance they get
>Trump and the majority of conservatives have zero issues with immigrants. The problem we have is specifically illegal immigrants. I see this “argument” thrown around frequently and it just comes off as silly and misguided.

Then why aren't there any real conservative endeavors to make legal immigration easier? Why aren't conservatives scrambling to encourage immigrants when immigrants make more jobs per capita through creation of businesses, tend to be more educated, wealthier, more successful, and contribute more to the economy?

Why do conservatives rally against the scapegoat of "illegal immigrants" when a bigger issue is American-caused instabilities in regions that immigrate to the US, all the while those undocumented immigrants are *also* beneficial to the economy?

The agricultural industry would crash if all illegal immigrants were immediately found and deported.

Ok sure, she totally didnt [mean it like that](https://youtu.be/NJC_MNjw4E0). And yes, you are literally saying we should do your shit jobs, I have a degree and I want to work as a professional animator, why the fuck should I be willing to clean your fucking toilet?

\>  immigrants are willing (or forced) to do jobs that Americans don't want to do

\> Immigrants do the jobs that americans are too good for

you are saying americans ARE above immigrants you moron. Immigrants are engineering your railways in California and keeping international trade coming into your ports in Texas.

If the job is so dirty that you dont want to do it, why do you believe i want to clean your shit? Chinga tu puta madre racista de mierda
Only if they're brown.
as a (swiss)german, i'd take to this badly in the first place.

but it is a whole other level of disrespect to say this with the possibility of the russians actually ethically cleansing a country with 44 mio inhabitants

you are throwing a word you don't know the meaning of around at everyone.

as a byproduct of this you are relevating the word fascist and fascism, thereby helping *actual* fascists.

forgive me my strong wording, but you are ignorant and an idiot.
Really bro? Someone disagree with you and you call them fascist? Really?
She did not say anything like that, and if you don't understand language and/or sarcasm, that's your problem. And don't you f\*cking put words in my mouth that I never wrote!
Good point I agree. Whelp my shitter is clogged with your garbage mexican degree you better get to it.

Filled 62 L of diesel in Norway today for 134$.

Exactly. But guess who backs the lobbies up... deh gobernmend.
That’s how inflation works. Plus is a high demand low supply economy for oil. In Needles CA gas is 7 dollars a gallon but right across the bridge in Arizona it’s 4. Explain that one.
For a second I forgot what group I posted this in
Oh they didn't get my vote
It's $2.63 cdn pr liter which is 19.80 Krone
Still cheaper then Canada so you got that going for ya
If they keep it 5 or 6 or 6.5, you’ll still go to the 1 across the bridge, so just keep it at 6.79 or whatever and make a decent profit from whichever   sucker fills it up. Why start at 5 is because of the 40 cent higher taxes. If a 40 cent higher taxes leads to an actual 3$ increase then of course it’s something else too
Haha. I didn’t even see it was in sarcasm
Damn Canada has more expensive gas that California? That’s depressing because our gas taxes are the worst in America

Are you asking for a friend?

Don’t get something big like a vasectomy for someone else!
Why would you do this to someone?
Vasectomies are reversible. It’s just a tube that gets cut but can easily be sewn back together to its original state
Install a self flipping light switch?
I think after a couple years it's got a very low success rate. You can't just go snip! Snap! Snip! Snap! Do you have any idea the toll four vasectomies have on a person?!
You know how expensive vasectomy reversals are?
Where did you get four from lmao. And yes of course it’ll have a low success rate after years. That’s how the body works with age
All surgeries are expensive
Kids are not cheaper
I believe that's a The Office reference
“AlL SuRgErRiEs…”

🙄

Except this $10k (on average) isn’t covered by insurance.

“Easily” is a wild word when it’s gonna cost a month’s worth of work (pre-taxes) to pay for it if you make $120k a year.
Was I comparing?

Not getting a vasectomy doesn’t automatically mean you’re going to knock someone up.
It had some influence for this
You might be right about that
A lot of surgeries aren’t covered by insurance. Also y’all are getting so worked up over something that isnt even being forced on you. I personally think condoms are a much better choice than a vasectomy or even birth control pills. I never once disagreed so why do you speak as if I’m against yall 💀
Fair call
I’m certainly not against vasectomies. I plan on getting one. But it’s ridiculous to wave it away like reversing one isn’t an extreme expense.

Totally agree on condoms and BC pills. 

And I will agree, physically, reversals are a fairly non-invasive procedure. Most households don’t have $10k to pay for a reversal, no matter how “easy” or straightforward it is.
I didn’t mean to sound like I was waving it off as something that can be easily done. Definitely don’t get a vasectomy if you can’t lol. I was just meaning that (if everything is in order for it) it can be reversed in the event both partners change their mind (which can happen) it’s not realistic for all people but without knowing they can be reversible many people can go against the idea of the surgery in general and spread more misinformation. That’s why I said what I said
That’s actually an awesome protest. Also why NSFW?
of course not, I don't even know what sarcasm means
Every day
Good to see crowley again
I once got a 30 day ban from r/roastme for being too sarcastic; my next goal is a perma-ban.
happens to me often enough, but im also bad at telling sarcasm myself, so although more than half of my personality is an immense amount of sarcasm, sometimes i can’t even tell when my best friend is being sarcastic or serious.
If everyone think you're serious then you just bad at sarcasm. It's not sarcasm if it's not obvious. You're just a tard who act smart if you think everyone else at fault when they don't get your sarcasm.
Each and every day of my life.
It is so depressing... You know me; do you really think that what I just said should be taken at face value?
Trust me, I take your sarcasm seriously just to annoy the shit out of you.

hmmmmm, i don’t think the milk has anything wrong with it, but check that it’s in date too just in case, and you are probably using the wrong needle, you need a bigger and longer one, since it’s so thick.
Nah your doing it right
Hey now it’s not 4/20 anymore you really shouldn’t be drinking the devil’s cum anymore it’s not good for your health, say no to drugs
Okay I'm going to invite you to play in my pretend world but you have to work out the details of the rules that I like to play with even if you don't want to. . if you can't play in my pretend world I'm going to make your life very difficult because I want you to play in my pretend world even though you don't want to... I hope you understand okay let's get started.. oh by the way the one who did not create the world gets to go first so go ahead
When injecting milk, for full flavour you want the maximum flow to be occuring in the palm of your foot. To achieve this, begin my inserting the tip of your milkeedle into your pinky toe. Don't worry if the needle goes right through, just keep pushing till it pierces into your second toe. Once the milkeedle is properly inside you, quickly slap the top of needle as hard and as fast as you can, so the milk is forced out like the beginnings of some horrible diarrhea. If you see your foot begin to swell from the excess fluid you're doing it correctly. To release the fluid once you're finished just unscrew your left testicle and relief your excess milk at any electrical outlet. 

Best of luck with next time.
Would you call my mama? I call my mama dead...

Oh, I will write my reply on a piece of paper too then. Is it comprehensible? Oh, almost forgot, you can' see it. Is there a problem with my paper? Or is it my writing?
I love this
Thank you. I bought  a longer and bigger one, and I'm currently injecting milk in it. I feel the taste now. Thank god someone like you exist!
Your mother's is my favorite. Is this a good answer?
Ur mom
Omg thank you. I will try that next time with my big and long needle
This is so wrong. If you want to taste it you need to main line it. You likely injected it into a minor vein. Next time inject it's into an artery. Even easier, start a PIC line. That's how I inject my coffee and heroine.
Oh man... My condolences. I hope my ur mom joke didn't hurt you in any way... If It did, I will gladly do anything so that you can forgive me.
Okay! Thanks for the advice!
I understand you. I do. How you feel. To feel and not being understood. And even though I have explicitly written how we feel, i bet no one else reading this can really understand. I don't know where i am going wrong.
of course! happy to help, glad you can finally inject choccy milk into ur veins in peace…..and tastefulness

Okay, I have some ice-cream right behind me. I will prepare the needle and inject it.
Sure dear. By the way the bread you wanted is over in the store.
No no mix it with the chocolate milk first.

Or you might get da PoTaYtOe disease.
I see, honey. If there's milk, I beg you on my knees and cry for you to buy it.
Oooh, okay! I will do it if I do not forger ☠️
I would have, love. But the last time I brought it, instead of drinking, you just put in your veins. It was such a mess. I will get it if you promise to do it cleanly this time?
ooomagad don't forgert !!!
Yeah, yeah. I promise, dear.
I will never forger!!!!

Congratulation/s ?

You're welcome!

Congragulation
Thank you very much!
Why would you black out your own username?
Are we using this sub to brag about our marginally clever posts now? Because I'm about to fill this mother UP.

...how is this ironic? At all?
I don't know, some subreddits are peculiar about blacking out stuff, I wanted to be safe.

check the pinned post for what is allowed and not allowed. i have a pretty specific guideline you can follow. for the time being, as long as the sub isnt being spammed by irrelevant content, most funny things are ok. sarcasm is 100% preferred though, which you can help with by giving sarcastic titles, comments, etc, to help make your post more fitting. things such as news articles with sarcastic titles work as well.
This sub is too serious for that.
Only on Thursdays.
No, only formal attire is allowed.

I believe that’s Cillian Murphy his quote from peaky blinders “Everyone’s a whore Grace, we just sell different parts of ourselves”
Hahaha, this is the first meme that made me burst out in laughter!
My kind of humor right here!
I didn't get it..mind explaining?
Yeah sure, ill try my best. English is not my first language so forgive me.

Basically, when he is asking the difference between a prostitute and a child, the question is pretty straightforward.

But when the guy doesn't say that he does not now.

Then he replies with "You sick fuck" implying that person who doesn't know the difference is a pedo.

Also the part that makes it even more funny for me is, look at decaprio squinting while he says "You sick fuck"

This is because a lot of the reactions are filmed and cut together in editing. Most of what you see in surprise or ovation may not even be in response to the moments you’re seeing. They’re just spliced together.

You do your work in stages, I haven’t worked in ship building but I did work in auto manufacturing and in a foundry at that. Each step or stage of construction/build has a purpose and is of course monitored. As you complete your portion of work for that stage you absolutely feel a huge sense of accomplishment even if it’s not completed yet. I never saw the complete cars, I made parts and cut off the excess metal, grinded the parts down and sent to X-ray to search for part defects and finally they go off to be machines poor to heat treatment. After which they are sent to another facility for the next stage.

The post in video is [I built a sarcasm converter for my keyboard to make it EaSy To TyPe SaRcAsTiCaLlY](https://reddit.com/r/funny/comments/scykg9/i_built_a_sarcasm_converter_for_my_keyboard_to/). It inspired me to make an extension + such a video of the process :)

Install extension in [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sarcasm-mode/fapcfchlipjimkokjhofdhiknnffjdkd).

Also I discovered that the extension does not work with Fancy Pants editor. I tried really hard to fix it, but the Fancy Pants editor is a tough nut to crack (I am not [the only one](https://reddit.com/search/?q=fancy%20pants%20editor) having issues with it, perhaps making an extension to fix it should be my next project). But the extension works on Markdown mode, so EvErYtHiNg is FiNe!
DaMn BrUh, ShItS BuSsIn!
Fancy Pants editor sucks.
I might try solving this problem. Can you give an example how it does not work for you?
Nothing to do with your extension, just the editor in general. It freaks out over minor problems.
I didn't mean my extension. I am wondering whether I could try fixing the editor in general. Could you elaborate on problems you encounter? Ideally how to reproduce them.
I think it needs a few more jokes thrown in. But other than that it’s an awesome and funny video. I’m definitely following your channel
why dont you lace it with some bitches
Thank you, I agree it needed some e laughter to it, it got a little more serious then I like to at the end like I said I hate being the preacher, thank you very much for the feed back! And the support!
It’s hard when talking about a serious topic. I myself feel like I’m feeling like I’m preaching to the choir. It’s a little bit frustrating. So I understand.
Naked ass bitches or just bitches? Bitches is a very multi lateral word! But I understand everyone loves them some bitches

Well good for me i become a extrovert when school starts
Whenever i hear someone that goes to my current school say they want to continue online:
"Hmm did they forget the best thing about this school is the lab facilities........"
Oh really? What are they
Well idk how it help me in the first place beside the only two months when I was at home the whole time
I can feel that.
I feel bad for you in areas like that. Where I live we only had about 4 wks of a "lockdown". And that was when it all started. Life pretty much went back to normal shortly after
Nope. no no no no. Noo.. .. . .  .

So true!
Do you need help??
It's the first time I haven't been called weird for preferring to be alone.
Lol good for you!
Wich me luck
Same situation here too
My husband is an extrovert and seems to think it is weird I like being alone so much.  It is really hard to try and explain to him that being alone is not depressing to me and people exhaust me!  This stupid world was made for extroverts!
It’s the first time I haven’t felt weird for being alone
You still get called weird; a "pussy" for being scared of a virus.

You think it’s funny to take screenshots of people’s NFTs, huh? You must be a very immature person to steal someone’s property that they PAID for. Yeah, I said it. You’re the kind of person who thinks that property theft (a seriously illegal offence) is a joke. I don’t even know why you took that screenshot, because you didn’t pay 1000 dollars for it. I did. The blockchain doesn’t lie. Even if you try to save it, it’s my property. You’re just angry that you couldn’t afford this priceless masterpiece. Even if you could, your fingers couldn’t even click fast enough to get one of the 10000 NFTs sold. You’re just mad you don’t own what I own.

So, delete that screenshot, or I swear, you’ll be hearing from my lawyers.

Back in my day we ate rocks and crickets and we were grateful! Damn kids these days…..

GOD DAMN IT FIND THE NIGHT I HATE YOU BECAUSE YOUVE TURNED MY STRUGGLE INTO YOUR STRUGGLE. AYYYYEEEEE YOU PIRATE ARRRRRR AYYYYYEEEE I KNEW A PIRATE ONCE HE often liked to just look out at sea.

But once piratism started being outlawed he couldn’t really do pirate things anymore. He had to watch all of his friends get arrested one by one while he flew under the radar. It wasn’t until a close call with the IPOOP (International Pirates Outlawed Order Police) where they literally ransacked his entire ship that he decided that he had to change career paths.

So change he did, he found a way to turn his pirate ship into a sailing caramel apple shop. He made a lot of money selling caramel apples to sailers who sailed by. Sometimes he’d even just set up at a harbor, I remember him distinctly setting up shop by the harbor in Ana Capri, Italy. He said birds would often come by and just watch him work. At first he found it quite strange, but eventually he got used to it. His life was definitely always changing, I can’t imagine the constant whiplash he must have felt.

Unfortunately his business had to come to an end when he was in his 60s. With Caramel and Apples becoming even rarer in the East/ Europe. A lot of raids would happen on his ship. Gunfire and hell would rain down mid moving period. He got captured by Vietnamese Pirates in the end and no one has heard from him in quite a bit. Probably safe to assume he passed. Let that be a test to karma, eventually the pirate got pirated. So don’t be a pirate.
This.

Edit: watched it with the wife and we laughed our asses off.  ‘Twas good.  Very funny video.
Yes honey I can’t wait to clean your pee splatter off the toilet again. Also your sons… also so excited to hear about your hard day at work when I also had a hard day at work…but I’m cooking dinner and cleaning up your dishes from this morning. Also…I love that you just leave your dirty clothes on the bedroom floor..so I know to wash them..even though I worked as much as you this week. Oh..you want a blow job? Of course..cause you worked this week and hahahahhahhaha imagine you giving me head and then just wiping your mouth and going to sleep while you listen to me happy snore.
lol very fitting for this sub
Wife to her friends: my husband is soo perfect i really cant stand him anymore i think i should break up
We need a wife’s version about horrible farts, destroyed bathrooms, whiskers all over the sink, how men nag and tell women how to do things when they shouldn’t be saying shit too, demanding a timely dinner when we’ve also worked a 9-5 shift etc… and I’m sure the $9 coffee is nothing compared to your “hidden snacks”….TRIGGERED. This was hilarious though lol
I'm offended by the level of accuracy...
Just shared with wife, will update on how it went.
I’m dying! 😂😂😂 Seriously LOL on the “crying during backrub”! I do it all the time! LOL... Totally sending this to my husband, he will get a kick out of it!
At least you get to pick your own outfit…..
I find it hard to believe that this guy actually has a wife.
ahh, this why i want to be single. not like i have a choice, im never gonna be able to ask a girl out ever
Can we make sure this mans alive after speaking all this truth.
I find Some of this shit is VERY accurate but then again even having this thought is probably why I’m single.
And you wonder why people don't like to say bros before hoes
I feel personally attacked as a wife oh damnnnn
R/savebot
Go send that man a suicide kit
Ugh, this gives off boomer “wife bad” energy, nasty
Jesus. What's in a Chai Latte ? Cocaine ?
Umm… of you can relate to this then you probably need to communicate with your wife about your feelings. Or you guys just aren’t meant to be. Either way, no one should feel like this in a relationship.
Yeah might want to hold off on this for me chief! Lol
Fucking this. It’s all I could think about when watching this. Like, some of this stuff is housework that benefits you both, so stop being a twat about it!
I suspect that when my husband sees a clean sink the lizard part of his brain begins screaming and he if FORCED by instinct to trim his beard IMMEDIATELY. Then half ass clean it up. All of these deep internal happenings obviously cause a strange spot of amnesia to form and cause him to not understand why I’m angry.
r/foundthemobileuser
Lol we don’t, don’t worry.  This video is more likely to spark a conversation about how well she and I work together, communicate, and respect each others hobbies and interests.  The only reason I’m debating it is because I told her I’m trying to cut the time I spend on Reddit down lol.
That’s a fucking stretch, Jesus. Interesting how whenever you go on some type of relationship subreddit no matter how petty or fixable an issue is there’s always thirty people screaming divorce this or red-flag your being abused that just for not taking your wife out for dinner one night
its not that deep fr
Shhhh, that’s the plan. Everyone leaves their S/O and begins dating Reddit. Reddit doesn’t want to be lonely anymore.
Ew.
Put this on tiktok and watch 11 year old kids laugh their ass off
Very strange seeing a Cookie Run meme here of all places.

Not even anyone in the fandom is funny
Because everyone in the fandom is 4
the hoo hoo man from cookie run is here
yeah
Exactly dude
Ppl who do the early morning workouts are uncanny at being able to do this.  But when you've got a whole bunch of endorphins still in your system that'll happen I suppose.
Mondays aren't Mondays for me, I work the weekend, and have Thursday/Friday as my days off.  So I smile on Monday when all the people bitch about Monday because I was there on Sunday when they weren't and can suck a dick, so my smile concealed my rage .
Awesome, should I buy a pistol and kill my teachers then
If my weekend was lit af, I'm going to smile from ear to ear while giving you the finger. That's how I keep my sanity.
Hahaha. No violence.
hahaha
U sound sarcastic as fuck🤣
Only the third one is correct.

Hmmmmmm I didn’t study enough for this.

i am not female.. and i am not american... but i find it little is done to counter this. where are the strikes, where are the march of people, where is blockading goverment buildings...

all there is are memes and angry tweets... its almost like noone really cares about it
My Mom feels this
Not like babies are being killed every day out of convenience... nope... definitely not happening...phew... be bad if it was am I right? 😅

Nothing and no one likes you Monday.
As a freelancer, all days are the same for me. I work at my own hours. I'm sometimes working on weekends and relaxing on weedays too.
Thanks, that's hilarious!
Seek help if symptoms don't abate in a few days. Stay hydrated.
So funny and believable 🙂
I'm trying to be strong. A great psychiatrist was recommended me by my late friend, oddly enough also downvoted once in a sub here. One can never stay well enough hydrated. I just finished a 45 minute urination. Next time I'm planning to try it in the bathroom.

Thanks for your support.

If only I'd seen this warning and been able to control myself. I fear that due to the enthusiasm of millions, the moment was destroyed.

I forgot.. She's in prison.
So have I. Is there a support group or 12 step program? 

They talk about the 7 stages of grieving but you need at least 9 stages for being temporarily banned from a sub. A famous person once said "Time heals all" but no one knows about the fine print just underneath it that says "Except for being banned for awhile from a subreddit". 

I'm so sorry.
Sure you posted this in sarcasm, but I can tell you are deeply hurt and angry. It's just a subreddit, you shouldn't take it so seriously.
oh shit, should i arrange a funeral?!
Thanks for sharing, now I can finally cry my ass off for a reason
Time doesn't heal all. 

You just learn to live in a new normal.  

Punch yourself in the face.  Hurts, right?  Do it everyday just as hard for 10 years.  Probably won't feel it at all by then.  But aren't you still hitting yourself just as hard as you did the first day?  Yup. Then why doesn't it hurt?  

Time doesn't heal shit.  You just go numb after a while.
NOOOOOOOOOOO IMI SO RFSOSRYR FOR UF, I GOTTGSA KIL THE SUBRFIT BECUS U GET NBAN
Deeply hurt and angry?? Are you joking?? 😂
We may need a six-pack of funerals. First the temporary bans and now even more foreboding signs on the horizon. Don't even ask.
Yeah. I was being sarcastic. Just goofing on you. Happy holidays!

BBC, BBC2, BBC3, BBC4, BBC6...they're all great...except BBC5. BBC5 is total garbage, run by garbage pandas in their garbage suits.

BBC1! BBC2!…
Walking with dinosaurs is bae
I don't understand... I feel silly but I like the BBC.
BBC actually fucking sucks
How is this sarcasm
All people ask shit that they know little about to people expecting them to know little too but then when they know more shit.  . That's the time to leave the person u asked on delivered which is really fucking annoying

If it was good toast then I don't see a problem
I sometimes feel bad for the guy who said this because I've always liked him and this quote has defined him for many people. He actually seems like a really good guy. But that being said, his success is in entertainment/acting. Maybe his charm is tricking me into thinking he's a cool guy.
And here's proof that being lack toast intolerant is financially beneficial... ahem.
Fr, not all of us want to be millionaires, some are just happy with toast
Holy shit, that was clever.
It's called being careful ig
people are totally not gonna reply to this sarcastically
Yeah cuz doing research on Reddit is useful and reliable. Man, you’re a genius.
Oh yeah, I’m totally sarcastic all the time. I’m your man. 🙄
how about LITERALLY ANYONE IN THIS SUB REDDIT!?! Ah dur.
I'm extremely sarcastic on a daily basis
Unsarcastically, MatPat at r/GameTheorists frequently used sarcasm in his Game Theory and Film Theory videos

what is sarcasm? i am a very serious man
I'm also reliable. Although I guess I could just drop a comment sarcastically...but who would do that?
My list up until now looks a bit like this:

Social Commentary:
- Sam Collins

- Eddy Burback
- Nickisnotgreen

Comedy:
- ShoeOnHead
- CasuallyExplained
- Cody Ko
- Kilian Experience
- Seth Meyers
- John Oliver
- Stephen Colbert
- Noel Miller

Video Essays:
- We're in hell
- Friendly Space Ninja
- Hbomberguy
- ContraPoints
You might consider some stand up comedians, idk if they fall under "content creator" but i do know some fall for their sarcasm, believe it malicious, and try to shut them up. Might be worth exploring.

S/support the woke, their empathy hurt.😉
Ngl then lie
That's cap

In my neighborhood it seems all owners let their pups out at 9PM. The symphony of barks over the entire neighborhood makes me laugh so hard sometimes. My boy gets zoomies every time

My aka is Nobody Important. Everything I register for, I'm Nobody Important. Real people comment with a laugh or pleasantry. Bots answer with "Thank You Nobody". A great Bot detector. I have phone numbers where the company grants an account with no real human seeing it. Fun, fun, fun.

"BANG"

You fell to the floor, blood flooding the scene. People gasped, people screamed, people gagged. You stared at the sky, the sun doesn't seem bright anymore for whatever reason. You realized you died as a virgin, realized that most of your time was spent on a glowing piece of... Thing, chatting to people you will never get to know. And while that was fun, you now realized that with that time you could've developed a hobby, get together with your family, learn new mind-boggling stuff. Tired and sleepy, you closed your eyes. You realized one last thing-

You never knew who Joe is.

You dreamt of adventures, dreamt of fantasy worlds, dreamt of imaginary scenarios with your crush. And after what seems like an eternity, the alarm went off.

You woke up to a world without people, a world without places to go, chores to do, hunger to solve, rent to pay, taxes to painstakingly calculate. But you're lonely. No people means no-one to bother you, but it also means no-one to play with, without places to go, you're confined to your room.

Well at least your computer is here. You sat on your gamer chair, and once again delved into the online world.

To add context this is for a “presidential speed dating profile” project for a high school government class I’m currently taking. Essentially we are tasked to make a speed dating profile based upon a randomly drawn US president, and share these profiles amongst peers. I’m not quite sure what the educational takeaways are here, but whatever. I hardly care enough to take this project seriously, so I’m making a joke out of it. This picture is meant to go along with one of the slides and I found it funny so I shared it.

Oh really?!

And I thought you were serius in r/sarcasm
Well, back in my day we had guns at school.  Guys had gun racks in their pickup trucks and every one held a .22 rifle in the rack.  Nobody ever messed with anyone and nobody had guns stolen either.  We even had shooting classes.
If the US had the same gun laws as Canada, they wouldnt have a gun violence problem, and as a consequence, would fix the gun violence problem in canada as it is largely from firearms smuggled from US.
Well, didn’t some buy in the 1950s run his election campaign on putting a color TV in every home? Every kid gets a gun is a great campaign quote, and some folks want 16 yr olds to vote to that will be even better!🤔👀🥴
Everyone knows guns kill people.
My pencil gave me bad grades
We have the godgiven right to keep and bear arms down here.  It doesn’t specify which armaments either, so I take a ballistic missile in the bed of my truck to school.  Pity the fool who wants to shoot up my school. Mutually assured destruction is the only way to keep the peace.

Yeah but weed isnt a deadly weapon in the wrong hands. Us needs stricter gun laws like Canada has. Its pretty strict up here with background checks and you get run through the police computer everyday, require a course, pass a test, apply, hope to get license in a few months. Things like handguns are restricted and can only be brought to a range, same with the AR when it was legal

*TWO TRUCKS HAVING SEX*
Ugh- ok- there was a movie where, during a business meeting, a guy tells a story about a truck getting stuck under a bridge and how no one could figure out how to get him un-stuck…. What was that movie ??? He says something like “well Ms. (character’s name) by letting some of the air out of our tires…” …ok that’s going to drive me nuts till I figure it out. This post reminded me of that line.. I can even see the actor in my head… what was that movie??
A Schneider National truck smh

Quick fix....let the air out of the tires.  Tow the truck out afterwards

I don’t agree with his tactics. If a store requires masks I shop elsewhere.
My immune system works just fine. No mask no vaccine!
Would have launched a jug of milk at his nuts
I'm changing my stance on vaccines.  I now agree that it is a personal choice to get the vaccine.  It is also a choice (option) to stay the fuck home when you get COVID and need care.  

If science wasn't good enough to keep you healthy then it shouldn't be good enough to help you recover.

Figure it out.  Yall just spare parts aintcha bud

Yeah dude, you’re gonna live forever
What about those whose immune systems don’t work fine and by not wearing a mask in an enclosed space could make them ill? Your post shows a lack of understanding and your mentality of only seeing things for how it affects you.
Moral decline.
If you have an immune disorder it is your responsibility to take care of you. You get a vaccine your protection, you wear a mask that’s your protection.
Vax for your protection, mask for everyone else cause we are all in this together. 

I'm so tired.   We have been dealing with COVID for coming up on two years and people still dont understand the point of masks.  You can potty train a child quicker...
That’s not how any of this works. You wear a mask to protect others from your germs. Immuno compromised people include children and those that can’t get a vaccine or are resistant, so the vaccine doesn’t create antibodies. Immuno compromised people need to work too, to survive. It’s nothing about fear or liberty, just common sense and not being an idiotic moron.
My liberty doesn’t end where your fear begins.
Wear your mask, it’s your choice.
Loving the lack of brain cells here bud
Right! And it’s less exhausting trying to potty train an infant than trying to help people grasp the concepts of how it all works, despite years of this same thing. It feels like Groundhog Day mixed with idiocrocy at this point!!
I believe the lack of education falls on you.
I didnt say anything about liberty but while we are on the subject please exercise that liberty to stay the hell home if you get COVID and it is bad enough to need hospital care.  Do your health care workers a solid.

I have no fear.  I'm vaxxed.   I'm not the one afraid of needles and sCieNCe.

I am of the mindset that there should not be a mandate.  People SHOULD just protect themselves, their families and their communities. 

I dont know about you but I would not walk through a gang neighborhood unless i had a piece of technology that science developed (a gun)that made me less likely to be a statistic.
So quick to throw insults.  Pretty common of antiva
Well It’s clear what you “believe” is not based in reality or science or evidence based facts, so that figures.
Awww, did I hurt your feelings? Do you feel victimized? Are you so upset you forgot how to spell vaccine?
Nah dude I'm fine.  The day I care about someone's opinion who can only throw insults and not back anything with actual scientific data is the day the earth will explode.  At which point I wont care then either.

Good talk though.   Really making the USA proud rn
If you cared about actual scientific data, you wouldn’t be antivax. The pseudo-intellectual Ben Shapiro act doesn’t work as well as y’all think it does. You don’t care about facts, you just don’t care about other people, and it shows.
I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

>If you believe that the Jewish state has a right to exist, then you must allow Israel to transfer the Palestinians and the Israeli-Arabs from Judea, Samaria, Gaza and Israel proper. It’s an ugly solution, but it is the only solution… It’s time to stop being squeamish.

Good thing he’s only bones now so he can fit in in my paper bag easily
Jesus. I am so fucking sick that this not only made me laugh, but I took the time to click on the post and reply. What a dick that guy was. How the fuck do you get off going out your way but Gabby didn’t? Asshat.
Who is this guy?
Brian Laundrie...
Did you get what you wanted? The guy in the pic is Brian Laundrie, and he murdered (they think) his girlfriend, Gabby Petito. Afterwards, his remains were found, & it appears he killed himself. Hence, self checkout.
Thank you for this
Is suicide confirmed??
His parents have known the whole situation since day one and still been hiding information and not cooperating with the police at all!!! His parents should be locked up for life!!!
Oh they found him dead.. oh what wonderful news
I have not been following this story at all. Can someone give me a rundown?
I get this is like the guy that killed us girlfriend or whatever, but not knowing the full situation, and with my name being Brian, you can imagine the confusion i felt when I saw this
And then the bag rips as soon as you pick the fucking thing up
I agree. It's disgusting, but great sarcasm, irony, whatever.
Well, whatever happens in death I’m sure he’s not really enjoying it or if he can’t to begin with. But it does kinda suck. Hopefully they can find some answers as to why this even happened.
Quarantine so much you don’t even watch any news?
Brian Laundrie, he recently killed his girlfriend while on a road trip. They just found his remains, presumably he committed suicide. The whole situation is tragic.
You're welcome.
Don't think so yet. Sounds like he got eaten by gators before or after death either way huh?
Yes. Sorry about the unintended personal reference...
Oh nah I live life so much I don’t stay watching news. I heard the story but hadn’t seen his picture
Did they confirm it was his? I’m aware they found his belongings but if they still didnt confirm then maybe it’s another sick way of distracting the fbi until he makes the grand escape
Hopefully before death
You’re good
They confirmed it was him through dental records. It’s not a movie.
Lmao sorry? Jesus

Do they have a power reservoir on days the wind is light or not blowing? We need more info. Guess I'll Google it.
Been there done that
Looks like it would capsize any moment.  Wonder how deep the hull is?
Why didn’t anyone think of this sooner?
those who feel obligated to always point out the joke trying to show everyone that they get it are dorks
A love tap?
This comment wins the day
Owowo
Good luck with that

Quit taking the wind out of my sails
It's "Any way the wind blows..."
That's a kind way of putting it.
I didn't circle it and I do agree
I'm something of an expert on this subject, and I agree with this comment.
Yeah thats it
I was referring to who I replied to, who’s comment was pointing out the joke
Doesn't really matter!!
Oh is that what you were doing? I had noooo idea (sarcasm)
If the taco filling was a pie-chart of what people would do if they found a millions dollars, they gave you the donate-it-to-charity portion.
They decided that today was your lucky day.
Mmm yes liquid taco meat in the middle
Becareful and get a napkin..it might overflow when you take a bite.
That is not a taco.
Are those like half reg price?
That’s some serious meat to put in your mouth
get off the phone youg man you may get hit!!
It's a mouse.
Nah, it's a lizard
I would never use sarcasm to point out the obvious.
Nah… What’s the fun in being sarcastic then?
I like how this was downvoted like someone didn’t view the “obligatory /s” lmao. I think it’s a good sarcasm post. Maybe the flair
This is incredibly important for the future. How about adding a couple of wind turbines so they can have electric power? Or is it better to just make the ship of wood & burn that for cooking fuel? That way, the ship could be recycled...
Wrong. These WERE green trees...

That's not sarcasm, that's just an untruth. Sarcasm would be "Wow, nice to see trees looking so green today"
i thought these are some cotton candies :D
Not sarcasm
Oh thank goodness that's true. If that wasn't true today abortions wouldnt be allowed!
I thought this was a pro choice sign for a minute
The toxic stupidity is not realizing that what the sign is saying is that a parent is supposed to have a right over what is best for their child's health. And when anyone on the left realizes that the percentage of people under the age of 18 who have died from covid is .00014 % can and still try to justify giving them an experimental vaccine that is true toxic stupidity
Stupid.   They are saying parents should have parental rights about their child's health.  Come on man you people are complete idiots trying to say the right are fools when the left can't even admit there are only 2 genders.  If the left was so great then why is California falling apart?
What is the point of this?
This is stupid
To show they're having fun
I find this quite rude and brash, I would appreciate if you turned around and left. Burger muncher.
I appreciate you
I’ve had this moment happen at work

No wonder the School Shooters Lobby-I mean GOP-wants kids back in schools.  They're pro-life up until the child leaves the womb.
Thats fucked. But sadly truthful
Well that escalated quickly.

Sarcasm would be “God, I can’t *wait* to get some Subway tonight”. Basically sarcasm is saying something while your tone indicates that you mean the opposite; but your words on paper don’t betray your true meaning. 

Calling the sandwiches bland show you don’t like them too obviously to be sarcasm.
My automatic sarcasm-oriented brain tried to detect a hidden layer of sarcasm here but couldn’t find one
That is not sarcasm
thats as dry as the mcchicken
The funny thing is that you proved that you do not know what sarcasm is.
You are about 1 part right and 3 parts wrong in this post.

One key problem with what you said is just the definition of autism. Autism is a spectrum, there are multiple levels of it. Putting all of the autistic population under one name like saying “autistic people don’t understand sarcasm” is like saying a gaming PC, X-Box and PlayStation are the exact same just because they all play games. Yes, they all play games, but there are literally thousands of other differences. So what I’m trying to say with that analogy is, you are probably part of a minority, but you are trying to claim that the whole of this people group is part of your minority. BTW, I haven’t checked how many autistic people understand things like sarcasm, but I’m pretty sure it is the minority that does understand.

Second off, I would argue that you don’t have a understanding of sarcasm just on the terms that language is so complicated that it is almost impossible to have a complete understanding of anything.

And finally, what the heck is your example of sarcasm there? I would also argue that subways sandwiches are not bland so putting that, especially as an example, where your topic is affected by opinions is not very good to prove your point. You can’t really use an example that so many people disagree with, that might make the impression that sarcasm is literally just saying the opposite of the truth for the sake of it. u/designerhoe in the comments used a better example and basically summarised my point here especially with how obvious you made your opinion.

BTW, please tell me if anything I have said is wrong, there are a lot of people spreading misinformation about these kinds of things and I don’t want to be part of it

Edit: mentioned the guy that said the thing in my final point instead of saying “someone else”
Yes
Wait is the sarcasm that the statement isn’t sarcastic
Thats not sarcasm, that's a dry joke.
This post feels strange I dunno why
Yeah you don’t understand sarcasm
It’s just one of the symptoms but it’s a spectrum so not everyone has all the symptoms. Like most of them also have problems with eye contact meanwhile some have no issues with it, or maybe even have ”too much” eye contact.
I see what you did there.....computer says no
This isn’t sarcasm. This is you exaggerating truth.  Not saying the complete opposite of the actual truth.
Tell me all of you, which bland Subway sandwich is your favorite?
Are you British?
It don't really work, calling it "bland" is just criticism.

You got to tie it all together, calling it "bland", without saying it, or saying the opposite.

A re-write into sarcasm could be:

"Subways new slogan, imagine eating a good sandwich.

Download their app, it has a perfectly Photoshoped picture of your sandwich, you can focus on, and imagine eating. 

Forget what's in front of you, and imagine a good sandwich" 

Sarcasm and irony, can be difficult to get a grip on, that's part of it's appeal, using double speak, and causing confusion, r/whoosh have some good examples.

Good luck.

Btw, I know it was rhetorical, but the Mexican is my favourite, i always get it, once got it with course bread, but i didn't like bleeding gums, mixed with jalapenos, didn't compliment eachother that well.

Still ate it, took it as a challenge. Subway always try to go viral, but they didn't seem interested in making it an official competition?!? Let it go viral on TicToc, making it a trend, i don't get it.
I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic.
Your mom is sarcasm.
Yes
I’m sureish
I always thought I was good with sarcasm. I do sarcasms all the time. But more often than not, I just don't notice when someone else uses sarcasm and I take it literally.

No, I'm not a kleptomaniac.
This flew over way too many peoples heads. He is being sarcastic about not understanding sarcasm.
*yay* i got the 69th upvote im *so so happy*
Everyone is different in every different circumstance; 
I think we can all agree on that
I have Asperger's and I understand sarcasm, especially really bad sarcasm where the person doing it doesn't understand what they're talking about in the first place. That's the best.
"I can't wait to get to work!" when the fact is you'd almost rather kill yourself is an example of sarcasm. It usually has to be ironic, like "Gosh, that guy can't possibly enjoy working at the puppy crusher! Oh! I see, that's the joke, he said the opposite. Gotcha."
As an autistic person, I struggle to tell if someone is being sarcastic or not. I dish out sarcasm like it’s nothing however. While I say that I struggle to tell if someone is being sarcastic, I can still typically tell.
It's a second order sarcasm, weaker than first order.
As someone who is autistic, and has actually been surrounded by sarcastic people growing up, I can say with absolute seriousness (yes, I am being serious) that you have no clue what sarcasm is.
Me too.
I’m autistic trust me
Yes… it is.
Holy crap. McDonald's is the #1 greatest restaurant in the whole wide world. I can't wait to eat more!
TL;DR
It’s autistic
This is , again, NOT sarcasm.
I don’t know the name as I just order the same as my partner does and it’s delish! We don’t get it often tho, but it’s our go-to every time! 

And don’t worry if you don’t get sarcasm. I don’t handle criticism very well, and i’d much rather not understand sarcasm in exchange for accepting criticism better. Also, I can’t remember the last time I heard someone use sarcasm. It’s not the be-all and end-all. Happy days!
Italian bmt!
Subway is disgusting (mostly I dislike that smell their "bread" makes), and I really dislike having to tell the clerk how to make my sandwich. You don't have to do this anywhere else, but supposedly it's a feature at Subway. Imagine this procedure introduced at Burger King, or Taco Bell. Nightmare scenarios.  
edit: My favorite is the meatball sub that tastes like someone's been holding it under their arm. Love it. Send me coupons.

What makes you think I’m a “He”?
I'm autistic, and no, it's not sarcasm.
An autistic post?
"This is , again, NOT sarcasm." is not sarcasm?

Wow really /OoO\

Sorry.
There’s a 50/50 chance, he took a punt.

Yeah
Nope

I can agree with the reality of the sarcasm being that she looks Japanese 🤣
Oh suuure, because the only reason, in this universe at least, that anyone would walk into a restaurant is to sit down and order food, sure. Nobody ever wants to grab a takeout menu, inquires about a gift certificate, makes a reservation for a later date, wants to know if you are open on upcoming arbor day, has questions about catering, is lost and needs directions or maybe even, and I'm being a bit nutty here, humor me, asks to use the bathroom.
Nah, I'd be like no table, just bring my food to the shitter, that's where I'm gonna sit.

Don't think it's sarcastic, it's just something he doesn't understand, and he sees it as suppression, so he stick it to a minority group?!? Funny.

His use of "superior" about intelligence, show the great irony in that sub, and in him.

If you feel superior to others, that's a sign of narcissistic personality disorder.

Using sarcasm, irony or ridicule, on people like that, works great, because they don't understand it, and takes themselves to serious, it is suppression of that kind of behaviour.

But some people believe, any sign of intelligence, is a sign of narcissism, or some superiority complex, it's not, and it's sometimes obvious how some protect themselves from feeling stupid, by stamping with the IAmVerySmart stamp of superior, when it really doesn't apply.

Science is mostly about always doubt your ideers, and test them, listen to others criticism, a superiority complex don't fit into it, it should be suppressed, and those that can't tell the difference from sharing knowledge/teaching, and feeling superior, should not judge.
Likely to be interpreted as sarcasm but I don't think that's what the we're going for unless they themselves are a genius.
