It's far from a dumb take imo. It's easier to find good class batters which we have enough of already. But to find a bowler like bumrah is at the moment next to impossible in indian cricket. Don't just downgrade a class cricketer just because he plays for a Franchise you dislike lol. Saying this as csk fan 0 11

Forget Ganguly, Dravid, Kumble, MSD, Kohli, Rohit. Bumrah's legacy is better than them all because he took 7 wickets in a test match. LMAOoooooo 0 42

I do feel like we should really give credit to the bowlers when they perform big . Batsmen get away with all the glory . 0 8

What that commenter said is ludicrous, especially at this point in his career, however people in the comments are minimizing his legacy. He will go down as the greatest bowler in Indian cricket history. Only wish he won more ICC trophies. 0 5

Actually bumrah is a class apart in the ongoing circuit of bowlers of course he does perform in the all the formats and by the careers end he will be our legendary bowlers maybe even surpassing zak. He is actually good dude the batters may not say it now but by the end of their careers many will 0 3

As an MI fan I can admit he is no where near the most important cricketer in our history (even though he is legit my favourite). There are so many others that have much better impact on the team than him but what’s the point on looking at this guys opinion and claiming it as an MI fans one just because it was posted it on our sub. He may be wrong but there are so many dumber takes from people in this sub as well. 0 2

He is right dumbo. 

Bumrah is the best bowler India has ever produced in all 3 formats. He is better than Shami,Zaheer, Srinath. 

He has been the number 1 ranked test bowler for some time now. I don't think an Indian quickie has ever done that.

MI did unearth this gem of a cricketer. 0 2

It really isn't that farfetched of a take. India has had plenty of top-level batters that could lay claim to being the best batter of their era, but few bowlers who could claim that they were the absolute best, until Bumrah. 

Unless he has horrible injury luck, he will go down as India's best ever bowler, if he already isn't. Followed by Ash. 0 1

I am not a MI fan neither do I think Bumrah is right up there yet but

I think if Bumrah manages to play for a few more years, he isn't far away from becoming the greatest pacer to ever play for India. Before Bumrah's arrival, the bowling was toothless in white ball cricket and in red ball cricket in SENA. Shami, Ishant all were good enough but none of them were the leader which Bumrah became very quickly in his career. You don't need to look far behind, just compare the WTC Final and this Cape Town test. In WTC, we didn't have Bumrah and see how we did. In this test, we didn't have Shami and see how we did. Nothing against anyone, but Bumrah is what Indian bowling always craved for and they finally got one, and it's only fair enough we respect him for that.

Talking about the important cricketers, I think, in no order, Sachin, Kapil, Kohli and Dhoni are the most important Indian cricketers ever. Kumble, Gavaskar and Dravid just after that. And then comes the likes of Ganguly, Zaheer, Harbhajan, maybe Rohit and the rest of them. 0 1

I can see the argument there, there has never been a bowler like Bumrah in india's international setup, there were always players with squandered potential. But, with Bumrah's emergence, Indian fast bowling has gained a new level of respect around the world, and Sachin kinda did with the bat as well. 0 1

I don’t support MI(actually hate them) but Bumrah is a better test player than anyone you mentioned.He averages 21 with the ball and in all our test cricket history the second best fast bowler is Shami at 28.That is a massive difference.

He is also top 3 all format player in Indian cricket history, Sachin and Kohli being the other two.So, all in all as a player his legacy would be up their with Kohli and Sachin. 0 28

He is a far superior bowler to Zak, he just needs to play for a few more years to catch up on volume. His only small glitch is not having won an ICC trophy. 0 3

I might get killed on here, but I think he is close. Because you have to see the reason why India is doing good outside India is because of its pacers. And Bumrah has been the backbone of our attack. Batting was never a problem for India, bowling is winning us series! 0 1

Bowling legacies are different than batting ones

I think Kapil Dev is India's best pacer and it's not even a debate, let's see how bumrah fares as he is quite injury prone

Comment ID: kgexz9i
Bumrah is at the top of 3 completely different cricket formats, is a top bowler in the IPL, plays in a batting friendly era with lesser test cricket and is still on pace to blow Kapil Dev’s bowling stats out of the water. Assuming he stays injury free he will go down as the goat no debate. Kapil Dev is ridiculously good considering he was an all rounder but on a purely bowling comparison is not better than Bumrah, plus he was a medium fast. 0 8
