I'm sarcastic much of the time, and have no close friends. But I have 6 pets that keep me laughing so, joy is in the eyes of its beholder.

I'm really sarcastic . People have asked what I meant by that, and it gave me a chance to explain why they were being not exactly smart. In most circumstances it's a learning experience

Learn where their values lie. If you know them to be good people, trust them. Assume the best of them. When you do that, if they something so blatantly mean, you'll know they must be kidding

I'm quite sarcastic myself too. It sometimes feels like more of a defence mechanism... I think it's best to not take what they say personally. If you can learn to tolerate someone that is mostly sarcastic then that's great. You could even answer them back with a sarcastic comment too, we'll most definitely laugh it off. I think being sarcastic is great but there's definitely a line to when one should and shouldn't be sarcastic

The worst you can do is take what a sarcast says litterally, as a sarcast eventually you begin to wonder if everyone is really stupid.. or realise its not effective to be sarcastic all the time .

Yeah that's the thing. I like sarcasm but I use it like salt to flavor food. Just enough and it's funny as hell. 
However too much, and I genuinely cannot tell if that person hates me or not, as the level of hostility is often the same.

Imagine if the things they are being sarcastic about are things that normally would cause insecurity. 
Aka, having to ignore them but then creating a deep sense of distrust within you.

I get where you are coming from. I've been called out a few times for my sarcasm by taking it too far. Kinda like saying¬†‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about what people think. They don‚Äôt do it very often.‚Äù My "problem" is that I also like to sprinkle in a little dark humour. And dark humour isn't for everyone

Honestly, good dark humor is funny as hell. I think dark humor is like butter. Just enough and man do you make a dish great.
